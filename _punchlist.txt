of doing this here (i.e. unlike Bulls)

A few little things I noticed as a website user/editor:

1) Numbered lists like 20 Questions (2014) and Cyprus Cinemas (2015) are
automatically indenting. I didn’t want to screw with the markdown/html.
Maybe there’s an easy way to do this you know about.

2) It doesn’t look like Optima has Greek character support. The Greek
characters are rendering in a different sans serif font. (Polish character
support is missing too. See PAWEL ALTHAMER.)

3) Link active color is the same color as the background color (white) so
the text disappears when the linked text is clicked. If that was
intentional, ignore this.

4) On tablets, the annual report index nav is getting cut off on the right
(the margins or padding seem to be too tight). Haven’t checked on mobiles.
It’s also overlapping with the text on top. And the two text columns aren’t
stacking. Don’t know if this is the look you were after.

5) The A-Z backlink doesn’t appear to be functional on the individual entry
pages.
