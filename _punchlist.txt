    + cleanup fullscreen transition
    + add $body
    + fix .centered
    - fix thumb click closure etc for img index #
+ replace X with a go back arrow or just remove X
x mobile for image pinboard
  full width and follow the text
x if no photos, the white space is too prominent
+ when texts are quite long after click need to scroll for photos
x dont know if it could work as a parallel column to the text.
+ click on date goes to that date

+ years aligmment, index.php / event.php
+ rewrite year-menu.php and year.php to be one, simpler etc
+ error 500 internal server configuration problem with loading year-menu.php on server in head.php
  in views/year-menu.php at $oo->get_all
  turns out the real problem is in open-records-generator/models/model.php
  where the DESC flag is still wreaking havoc
+ update open-records-generator on local (git submodule etc)
+ reduce all img sizes
x dot only to blink on rollover (expand width of dot div) or red
+ hover / active states css
x add target to all a href elements? processed in markdown?
x doesn’t look like Optima has Greek (or Polish) character support. The Greek 
characters are rendering in a different sans serif font.
+ link active color is the same color as the background color (white) so the 
text disappears when the linked text is clicked. If that was intentional, 
ignore this.
+ a-z link fix on second-level pages
+ meanwhile ... * fix *
+ sign pictures (PDF covers)
x css 4 column float
+ hide years on a-z page

  for ex http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/text-by-natalie-heller
  and http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/participants
+ hand on home page, animate pointing right
/ a-z remove duplicates by setting active=0 in objects table
/ mobile css in process
  #year-menu, .year-container, .digit-container, .h-centre
- on tablets, the annual report index nav is getting cut off on the right
(the margins or padding seem to be too tight). Haven’t checked on mobiles.
It’s also overlapping with the text on top. And the two text columns aren’t
stacking. Don’t know if this is the look you were after.
+ meanwhile menu, try | in place of / or .
- mobile css cleanup
- database cleanup

* skype 11/22/2017

- 11/22 andre to try and make an "index" which will appear as a second 
page after the annual report scrawl page. then, visualize this

- options are to 

1. annual reports with index
2. annualreports.pointcentre.org  and www.pointcentre.org
3. delete annualreports, make only www.pointcentre.org
 
+ change a-z to index
  views/index which indexes events by category, by year
- search

- still problems with url.php
  works on localhost, does not work online
  on localhost, url.php is in open-rec-gen/config
  same on remote but doesnt work
  expect it is to do with the $_SERVER_REQUEST_URI 
   which is literally what url is requested and there may be a better way
  also need to resolve whether this is an update to o-r-g which it should be

- /open-records-generator/config/url.php --> urls built in views/head.php 
  and then new URL object is passed a $urls array

- /config/url.php --> urls are only built from $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']

** goal is to reconcile these two into one if possible **
