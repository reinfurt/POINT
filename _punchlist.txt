- actually i can’t see where that first big 2013 vertical indent (TM) comes
from, i.e. how Andree may have unknowingly flipped the pizza switch. it
happens on the other year pages also, and am suspecting it might have

the homepage, i.e. as if the “Frame” of that “text box” is pushing the
text on subsequent pages downwards?
