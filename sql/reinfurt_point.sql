Michael is a well-known Cypriot designer, Royal College of Art-educated and now working in London. He first met Andre at Point during its launch exhibition.\r\n\r\nPredominantly made of sandstone and steel, the works in the exhibition address the economic crisis in Cyprus in a more or less oblique fashion. The pieces are produced by Michael and, as far as possible, they are made in Cyprus. Michael’s [private view](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/view) is a significant event in Nicosia’s social calendar. On the day after the opening there is a [round table discussion](https://vimeo.com/186437442) involving Michael, the design writer [Justin McGuirk](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/justin-mcguirk), the architectural photographer [Hélène Binet](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/hlne-binet) and the graphic designer [Omar Sosa](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/omar-sosa).\r\n\r\nThe catalogue for the exhibition launches several weeks later, on 27 February. It is designed by Omar Sosa and includes installation photographs by Hélène Binet. The catalogue contains [texts](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/texts) by Michael’s long-time friend [Eleni Xenou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/reload-the-current-page-ii) and the London-based design writer [Emily King](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/emily-king). Emily visits Cyprus with Michael for the launch. The [catalogue](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/publication-launch) is elegant, but being soft-backed and measuring 28.5 by 43.5 cm, it is hard to shelve.\r\n\r\nOn 22 March the [A.G. Leventis Gallery](http://www.leventisgallery.org/home) opens around the corner from Point. A new building dedicated to the collection of late Cypriot business magnate [Anastasios G. Leventis](http://www.leventisfoundation.org/en/about-us/ag-biography), it has a significant [installation of lights](http://studiomichaelanastassiades.com/exhibitions/ag-leventis-gallery) by Michael in its lobby. It is another important social event in Cyprus. On 21 and 22 March Michael leads [tours](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/reload-the-current-page-exhibition-guided-tours) of the Point galleries. The exhibition closes on 26 April.\r\n\r\n5 May, Point hosts a [book launch](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/book-launch) for Yiannis Toumazis’s [Marcel Duchamp, Artiste Androgyne](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/marcel). Yiannis Toumazis is the long time director of the [Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre](http://nimac.org.cy), which is housed in a former powerhouse in the old city. He is a leading cultural figure in Cyprus and in 2006 was the general coordinator of the aborted exhibition [Manifesta 6](https://manifesta.org/manifesta-6/).\r\n\r\n23 May, Point hosts a [discussion](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/discussion-with-zelia-gregoriou-and-stavros-karayanni) billed as *Art-official Designs: Regulating Artistic Expression and Practice*. [Zelia Gregoriou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/zelia-gregoriou) addresses ‘queer aesthetics’ and [Stavros Karayanni](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/stavros-karayannis) discusses the ‘embodiment of gender’. This event anticipates [Cyprus’s first gay pride march](http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/06/01/all-different-all-equal/) on 31 May. That celebration is attended by more than 4000 people, but also attracts counter-demonstrations by Orthodox Christians.\r\n\r\nChallenging the preconception that political discussion in Cyprus must be confined to the island’s continuing economic crises, on 15 May Point opens an exhibition of films by the Swedish artist [Petra Bauer](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/petra-bauer). Their collaboration started the year before, when together with [Contour 2013](http://www.contour2013.be/en/) they produced Petra’s book [Choreography for the Giants](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/publication). Titled [*Sisters! and other films*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/petra-bauer--sisters-and-other-films), the exhibition is curated by [Jacob Fabricius](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/jacob-fabricius), who is now the director of the Kunsthal Charlottenborg in Copenhagen. The opening [talk](https://soundcloud.com/user-281493574/film-as-political-practice-jacob-fabricius) by Fabricius is titled *Film as Political Practice*. The exhibition comprises [five films](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/film-summaries), amounting to 279 minutes of screen time. The central film *Sisters!* is a collaboration between the artist and [Southall Black Sisters](http://www.southallblacksisters.org.uk/), a London-based feminist group that was founded in 1979 to engage with the social and political conditions of black and minority women. It is a document of a week in the life of the organisation. The exhibition closes on 28 June.\r\n\r\nBetween 25 June and 1 July Point co-hosts [Images and Views of Alternative Cinema Film Festival](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/images--views-of-alternative-cinema-film-festival) with the Ministry of Education and Culture, Brave New Media and the Directors Guild of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nJuly and August: Summers in Cyprus are long and deep.\r\n\r\n10 September, [*Entitled*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/panayiotis-michael-entitled), a solo exhibition by Cypriot artist [Panayiotis Michael](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/panayiotis-michael), opens. It is a restaging of the show that was the culmination of the artist’s residence at the [Künstlerhaus Bethanien](http://www.bethanien.de/exhibitions/panayiotis-michael/) in Berlin. During the opening there are drinks and music in the [garden](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/garden-panayiotis-opening). The [exhibition](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/installation) concerns the domestic ideal. It is the first time that Point uses its now defunct café as an exhibition space. Andre is ambivalent about using said space.\r\n\r\nOn 30 September the artist and [Louli Michaelidou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/louli-michaelidou) hold a discussion titled [*20 Questions*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/20-questions-panayiotis-michael-in-conversation-with-louli-michaelidou). There is no record of how many questions are asked. Louli Michaelidou works at the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture and has a PhD from the Royal College of Art in London with a [thesis](http://www.rca.ac.uk/students/louli-michaelidou/) connecting contemporary Cypriot art with postcolonial theory.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition closes on 10 October.\r\n\r\nIn October Point appoints [Ioanna Maki](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/ioanna-maki) to launch [*Campaign for Culture*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/media/00211.pdf), with the aim of promoting culture as a tool for economic and social growth. [Individuals](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/interviewees) from various art disciplines are interviewed about the importance of culture in general and the problems they encounter in their fields, both in making their work in Cyprus and in finding a Cypriot audience. They discover that the Cypriot government systematically underestimates the role of culture in the economy. \r\n\r\nThe scope of the original project expands beyond its timeframe and budget. The interviews remain a latent resource.\r\n\r\nBetween 31 October and 29 November the sound artist [Yiannis Christofides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/yiannis-christofides) stages the exhibition [*The Blind Ear*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/yiannis-christofides-the-blind-ear), a ‘multichannel sonic environment’. There is a full programme of [related events](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/related-events), including performances and workshops. This attracts a new music-focused crowd to Point, an audience that includes members of [HELMCA](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/untitled), the Hellenic Electroacoustic Music Composers Association. [Andreas Vrahimis](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/andreas-vrahimis) writes a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/text) to be included in the exhibition leaflet. ‘The blind ear allows us to answer both yes and no,’ he argues.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Nicosia’s Eleftheria Square the site of an [ambitious scheme designed by the architect Zaha Hadid](http://urbannous.org.uk/Zaha-Hadid.htm) with the aim of reconnecting the old and new towns is falling into ruins before it is even built. The project was originally scheduled for completion in Spring 2013. Delays are blamed on various factors, including a disagreement between the architect and the contractor as to the colour of concrete and the unanticipated discovery of antiquities. Costs spiral, but the municipality of Nicosia risks losing, or worse, paying back the EU grant for 85% of the funds if they cancel construction.\r\n\r\n5 December, Hélène Binet returns to Point for the opening of an [exhibition](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/maria-and-neoptolemos-michaelides-residence-by-neoptolemos-michaelides) of her photographs of the house of the celebrated Cypriot architect [Neoptolemos Michaelides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/neoptolemos-michaelides). The architect was the mentor of Michael Anastassiades. Some of the photographs are published in [*Apartamento*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/apartamento), a magazine produced in Barcelona by Omar Sosa, for which Michael writes the accompanying text. To an extent, the exhibition is a reconfiguration of the major actors in Michael’s earlier show. Hélène gives a [talk](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/helene-binet-artist-talk) the day after the opening and there are [parallel readings](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/parallel-readings) by architect [Petros Phokaides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/petros-phokaides) and the art collective [pick nick](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/pick-nick), among the leading lights of which is the artist Panayiotis Michael.\r\n\r\nHélène’s pictures reveal the patina of everyday life in [the former home of Maria and Neoptolemos Michaelides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/the-house). This beautiful but honest representation proves controversial in Cyprus, where leading architectural figures are very protective of the architect’s reputation and unaccustomed to his coming to international attention. The guardian of the Neoptolemos Michaelides estate, the architect Haris Hadjivassiliou, writes an [essay](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/exhibition-booklet) to be featured in *Domus* stressing the ‘classical components’ of the house.\r\n\r\nThere is a [workshop discussion](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/parallel-readingsworkshop---discussion) on 31 January and the exhibition will finish its extended run on 7 Feb 2015.\r\n\r\nThe last event of 2014 proper is a [debate](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/cultural-democracy-debate) about the politics of culture led by the Greek cultural politician [Myrsini Zorba](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/myrsini-zorba).',''),(4,1,'2015-08-25 13:28:35','2017-10-18 11:39:37',10,'2013',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','In 2004 [fire guts the interior](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/fire) of the Nicosia video game arcade Point. By unfortunate coincidence, it is the day that [Andre Zivanari](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/andre-zivanari), now the director of the Point Centre for Contemporary Art, buries her father. The premises belongs to her family company and for several years insurance negotiations rumble back and forth while the space is left a charred shell, complete with cindered gaming cabinets. In 2010 Andre conceives [the idea of a contemporary art space](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/history). Although teaching at the University of Nicosia at the time, she was always involved in the family business and has an instinct for commerce. The initial idea is to open a café within the space that will fund the showing of art. She now admits this was unrealistic.\r\n\r\nIn September 2012 Andre cooperates with the Mexican curator [Juan Gaitan](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/juan-gaitan) to assemble an international group of contemporary art operators in the seaside resort of Protaras to discuss the potential of the space under the portentous title [The First Council of Nicosia](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/the-first-council-of-nicosia). The discussion revolves around the nature of the café, the space and the fate of the building’s seductively sooty interior. In the evenings they drink Greek Mojitos made of mastiha, basil and rum prepared by the architect Andreas Angelidakis. They choose the name Point as [an emblem of its past](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/point-neon). Among Juan Gaitan’s [conclusions](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/report) is that ‘Point is not a centre.’ [The Point Centre opens](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/mission-statement) two months later.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, Point collaborates with the Malmö-based curator [Jacob Fabricius](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/jacob-fabricius) on the billboard project [*Show Off*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/show-off), running from September to December 2012. Six artists, including the Cyprus-born, Berlin-based Haris Epaminonda and Danish collective Superflex, show [billboard posters](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/show-off-banners) on hoardings around Nicosia and Malmö. The project is inspired by the multitude of mysteriously empty billboards in Cyprus. For the first time some [related works](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/show-off-installation) are shown in Point’s recently refurbished galleries. In the meantime, Andre receives [40 postcards](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/olivia-plender-publication) sent by Olivia Plender from Occupied East Jerusalem. Superflex also stages a performance in the Nicosia branch of Taco Bell, which is part of Andre’s family business. Called [Free Shop](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/free-shop), it involves not charging customers for food and drink for an afternoon. Customers are delighted, but trade is slow.\r\n\r\n15 December 2012 is the [official opening](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/point) of Point. The maiden exhibition, [*7 Films: Harun Farocki*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/7-films:-harun-farocki), is jointly curated by Andre and [Mats Stjernstedt ](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/mats-stjernstedt) of the Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo. Andre transforms Point into a high-quality screening room, the likes of which the artist has encountered in Jeu de Paume and MoMA. Farocki chooses to attend the opening in Cyprus rather than in Norway, and delivers a [lecture](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/harun-farocki-lecture). Meanwhile, upstairs [Point houses the Bidoun Library](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/bidoun-library), a travelling collection of printed matter loosely related to ‘the vexed concept of the Middle East’. Both shows run until 15 February 2013.\r\n\r\nEarly in 2013, just as Point’s [café](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/point-cafe) gets going, the scale of the Cypriot economic problem becomes apparent. Over the next year the immediate environ of Point becomes a street of shuttered shops. \r\n\r\nOn 26 January Andre lends the space to a young initiative platform called [Corporate Dance Disorder](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/corporate-dance-disorder) to stage an event. This is the first of many times that she will allow others to use the space. On 9 February Dr [Costas Constandinides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/costas-constandinides) from the University of Nicosia leads a seminar on [Film Reviewing for Beginners](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/film-reviewing-for-beginners) and on 12 March the artists group [Re Aphrodite](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/re-aphrodite) collaborates on a conversation [*On Collaboration*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/on-collaboration). \r\n\r\nOn 25 March it is announced that many Cypriots would lose a percentage of their bank savings in a financial manoeuvre known as a ‘haircut’. On 13 April Point hosts a discussion by the [Bank of Commons](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/bank-of-commons) on *Alternative Solutions for Cyprus*. It becomes clear that, at least for the meantime, the immediate economic crisis will overshadow any broader political discussion. \r\n\r\nThe general prospect is gloomy, but for Andre it is brightened by the arrival of [Chrystalleni Loizidou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/chrystalleni-loizidou), who becomes Point’s ’research manager’. \r\n\r\nIn April Point screens films as part of [Cyprus Film Days](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/cyprus-film-days), an initiative of the Ministry of Education and Culture in collaboration with the Rialto Theatre in Limassol. \r\n\r\nFrom 21 May to 20 July Point presents [*Displays*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/displays), a cumulative exhibition of Cyprus’s national art collection. [Works](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/exhibition-and-events) chosen by 27 significant cultural figures are brought to the gallery for [discussion](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/displays-discussions) and then become part of the [exhibition](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/displays-exhibition). Each participant  contributes a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/participants) on their chosen artwork. The show invokes the metaphor of the [Lapidarium](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/lapidarium), a place for exhibiting archaeological fragments. Like most national art collections, Cyprus’s holdings are the subject of various controversies revolving around the financing of their acquisition, their role in representing the state, and their accessibility. The philosopher [Andreas Vrahimis](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/andreas-vrahimis) contributes a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/text) rather than a work. There is heated debate and a big local audience. Point installs security cameras to protect national treasures. *Displays* is [mentioned](http://artforum.com/picks/id=41850) by the writer [Chris Bors](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/chris-bors) on the *Artforum* website. It is Point’s first appearance in the international media. Point exists!\r\n\r\nOn 24 and 25 May the artist [Lia Haraki](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/lia-xaraki) presents a [performance](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/tune-in) work in preparation for her participation in the joint Cyprus and Lithuania Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale.\r\n\r\nOn 5 July a round table on [*Art and Culture in a Period of Crisis*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/art-and-culture-in-a-period-of-crisis) dwells on the lack of an art college in Cyprus. Cypriot artists and curators have to study abroad and, as such, tend to be drawn from a small elite. This makes them feel bad. Arguments for the promotion of public engagement with art appear to come from a position of privilege. \r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on 27 July, the artist [Natalie Yiaxi](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/natalie-yiaxi) unveils a [project for the café’s outside wall](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/the-wall), a text piece that plays on the names of typical Cypriot villages. It is meant to launch a series of works for the café wall, but in fact it is the first and last. Curated music events take place during autumn. The café installs a bread oven. The produce is delicious, but not profitable. Dough does not make ‘dough’.\r\n\r\nIn its first year, Point receives 70% of its funds from private sources and 30% from the [Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture](http://www.moec.gov.cy/en/cultural_services.html). \r\n\r\nAugust – September: Summers in Cyprus are long and deep. \r\n\r\nSeptember, [Demetra Ignatiou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/demetra-ignatiou), formerly an intern at Point, becomes the gallery’s first full-time employee. \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 9 October [Haris Epaminonda](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/haris-e)’s exhibition [*Chapters*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/chapters) opens at Point. Andre has worked [with Haris](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/haris) since 2010 and produced the film that was the centrepiece of the exhibition in 2013. Making that piece, itself titled [*Chapters*](https://vimeo.com/163972108), remains Andre’s proudest achievement. The non-narrative four-hour film was made in collaboration with the [Museum of Modern Art in Oxford](https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk), the [Fondazione Querini Stampalia](http://www.querinistampalia.org) in Venice and the [Kunsthaus Zürich](http://www.kunsthaus.ch), but it is the sum of Haris’s and Andre’s efforts. Overcoming a lack of experience and resources, they [produce](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/behind-the-scenes) a piece of work that is significant both for Haris and for Point.  \r\n\r\nOriginally shot on 16mm, the film is transferred to digital and shown as a [four-channel video installation](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/video-installation) with a soundtrack composed by the British sound artists [Part Wild Horses Mane on Both Sides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/part-wild-horse-mane-of-both-sides) in Point’s upper gallery. The ground floor galleries are devoted to [sculptural works](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/sculptural-works) assembled from found and constructed objects. \r\n\r\nAt Haris’s request, on the day after the opening, 10 October, Point hosts a [presentation](https://vimeo.com/162247652/c77953d7d0) by the Italian architect [Andrea Bruno](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/andrea-bruno). In 1989 Bruno completed the site museum at [Maa-Palaiokastro](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/museum-of-nothing), in Cyprus. Poised over a significant archaeological site, the domed copper structure was originally intended to house nothing. In the end the [Cyprus Department of Antiquities](http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/da/da.nsf/All/8C0E47DE260B1F43C2257657002581FD?OpenDocument) reneged and installed a small archaeological exhibition inside. Bruno’s talk is titled *Museum of Nothing: Is it really a Museum of Nothing? Nothing? Nothing? Nothing? Why?* The sculpture curator [Pavel Pys](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/pavel-pys) responds with a talk titled *Space, Setting and Narrative: Thinking around Haris Epaminonda\'s Chapters through the work of Carlo Scarpa*, a presentation that anticipates the [installation of the film in the Scarpa](http://www.querinistampalia.org/ita/contemporaneo/arte_contemporanea/conservare_il_futuro/haris_epaminonda/immagini_dellesposizione.php) designed by Querini Stampalia]( in March 2014. \r\n\r\n*Chapters* is [reviewed](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/frieze-review) in the March 2014 issue of London-based art magazine *Frieze*. This is Point’s second mention in the international print media. The Australian writer [Wes Hill](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/we-hill) notes ‘Epaminonda’s preoccupation with Cyprus’s art-historical identity’ and suggests that it is ‘an aspect of her work that can seem obscured by exoticism when shown outside of its local context.’ Itinerant critics are keen to demonstrate sensitivity to locale. \r\n\r\nInitially intended to run until 6 December, the exhibition is extended until the 20th.\r\n\r\n',''),(5,0,'2015-08-25 13:28:44','2016-04-18 18:26:01',10,'2012',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','An annual report is a [comprehensive report]() on a company\'s activities throughout the preceding year. Annual reports are [intended]() to give shareholders and other interested people information about the company\'s activities and financial performance. They may be considered as grey literature. Most jurisdictions require companies to prepare and disclose annual reports, and many require the annual report to be filed at the company\'s registry. Companies listed on a stock exchange are also required to report at more frequent intervals (depending upon the rules of the stock exchange involved).\r\n\r\nGrey literature (or gray literature) is a type of information or research output produced by organisations, outside of commercial or academic publishing and [distribution channels](). Grey literature may be in print or digital form and common grey literature publication types include reports (annual, research, technical, project etc.), working papers, government documents, and evaluations. Organisations that produce grey literature include government departments and agencies, civil society or non-governmental organisations, academic centres and departments, and private companies and consultants.\r\n\r\n[Grey literature]() exists on a publishing [spectrum](), with [commercial and scholarly publishing outputs]() such as books, journal articles, magazines and newspapers at one end (sometimes referred to as black literature), and unpublished materials such as personal notes and ephemera at the other (sometimes referred to as white literature).\r\n\r\nGrey literature may be made available to the public, or distributed privately within an organisation or group, and [often lacks systematic means of distribution and collection](). The standard of quality, [review and production can also vary considerably](). Grey literature is therefore often difficult to discover, access and evaluate.\r\n\r\nThe [concept]() of grey literature has gradually emerged since the [1970s](). When Charles P. Auger published the [first edition of his landmark work on \"reports literature\"]() in 1975, he did not use the term \"grey literature\".[1] Nevertheless, his account of this \"vast body of documents\", with its \"continuing increasing quantity\", the \"difficulty it presents to the librarian\", its ambiguity between temporary character and durability, and its growing impact on scientific research, was entirely compatible with what is now called grey literature. While acknowledging the challenges of reports literature, he also recognized that it held a \"number of advantages over other means of dissemination, including greater speed, greater flexibility and the opportunity to go into considerable detail if necessary\". For Auger, reports were a \"half-published\" communication medium with a \"complex interrelationship [to] scientific journals\". Only in the second edition of his book, published in 1989, did he adopt the term \"grey literature\".[2]\r\n\r\nThe so-called [\"Luxembourg definition\"](), discussed and approved at the [Third International Conference on Grey Literature]() in 1997, defined grey literature as \r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 200px; font-style: italic;\">\r\nthat which is produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats, but which is not controlled by commercial publishers\". In 2004, at the Sixth Conference in New York, a postscript was added for purposes of clarification: grey literature is \"...not controlled by commercial publishers, i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body\".[3] This definition has since been used extensively and is widely accepted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Interagency Gray Literature Working Group (IGLWG), in its [\"Gray Information Functional Plan\"]() of 1995, defined grey literature as \r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 200px; font-style: italic;\">\r\nforeign or domestic open source material that usually is available through specialized channels and may not enter normal channels or systems of publication, distribution, bibliographic control, or acquisition by booksellers or subscription agents.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nOther terms used for this material, both [in the past]() and [still today](), include report literature, government publications, policy documents, [fugitive literature](), nonconventional literature, [unpublished literature](), non-traditional publications and many others. With the introduction of desktop publishing and the internet, new terms added to the list include electronic publications, online publications, online resources, open access research, digital documents, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile the term grey literature is fairly obscure and difficult to define, it has the advantage of being an agreed collective term that researchers and information professionals and researchers can use to group and discuss [this distinct group of resources]().\r\n\r\nIn 2010 D.J. Farace and J. Schöpfel pointed out that existing definitions of grey literature were predominantly economic, and argued that in a changing research environment, and with new channels of scientific communication, grey literature needed a new [conceptual framework]().[4] They proposed a new definition (\"Prague Definition\"): \"Grey literature stands for manifold document types produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats that are protected by intellectual property rights, of sufficient quality to be collected and preserved by library holdings or institutional repositories, but not controlled by commercial publishers i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body.\"\r\n\r\nToday, due to the overwhelming success of web publishing and access to documents focus has shifted to quality, intellectual property, and curation. Without the revision mentioned above, the current definition risks becoming [obsolete due to its inability to differentiate grey literature]() from other documents.\r\n\r\nThe term grey literature refers to [a large number of resource types]() including institutional reports, annual or activity reports, [project or study reports](), technical reports, government reports, [research reports]() etc. In the other categories, citation analyses[5] offer a wide range of grey resources. Besides theses and conference proceedings, they also include unpublished manuscripts, newsletters, recommendations and technical standards, patents, [technical notes](), product catalogs, data and statistics, presentations, malin-grey literature, working papers, field notes, laboratory research books, preprints, academic courseware, lecture notes, and so on. The international network GreyNet maintains an online listing of document types.[6]\r\n\r\nOrganisations produce grey literature as a means of encapsulating, storing and sharing information, for their own use and for wider distribution. This can take the form of a record of data and information on a site or project (archaeological records, survey data, working papers); sharing information on how and why things occurred (technical reports and specifications, briefings, evaluations, project reports); describing and advocating for changes to public policy, practice or legislation (white papers, discussion papers, submissions); meeting statutory or other requirements for information sharing or management ([annual reports](), consultation documents); and many other reasons.\r\n\r\nOrganisations are often looking to create [the required output]() and share it with [relevant parties]() quickly and easily, without the delays and restrictions of academic journals or book publishing. There is often little incentive or justification for organisations or individual staff members to publish in academic journals or books, and often no need to charge for access to organisational outputs. Indeed, some information organisations may be required to make public. On the other hand grey literature is not necessarily always free, with market reports in particular, selling for thousands of dollars. This is however the exception, and on the whole though, grey literature, while costly to produce, is usually made available for free.\r\n\r\nWhile the production and research quality may be extremely high (with the reputation of the organisation vested in the end product), the producing body, not being a formal publisher, generally lacks the channels for extensive distribution and bibliographic control.\r\n\r\nInformation and research professionals generally draw a distinction between ephemera and grey literature. However, there are [certain overlaps between the two media]() and they undoubtedly [share common frustrations]() such as bibliographic control issues. [Unique written documents]() such as manuscripts and archives, and personal communications, are not usually considered to fall under the heading of [grey literature](), although [they again share some of the same problems]() of control and access.',''),(6,1,'2015-08-28 05:47:41','2017-10-11 11:44:12',30,'2015',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','7 March, the Cypriot artist [Christodoulos Panayiotou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/christodoulos-panayiotou)’s exhibition [*Stories from the Lives of My Friends*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/stories-form-the-life-of-my-friends) opens at Point. He borrows his title from an unfinished novel by Anton Chekhov. It is the artist’s first solo show in Cyprus.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition includes both existing and new works. Among the latter are a number of [natural stone mosaics](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/mosaics) representing the weeds that grow atop classical [Cypriot mosaics](http://d2aohiyo3d3idm.cloudfront.net/publications/virtuallibrary/0892361883.pdf) that have been reburied for their own preservation. These pieces are made in collaboration with a [local expert](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/lefteris-charalambous).\r\n\r\nThe installation is demanding for [Andre](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/andre-zivanari) and [Demetra](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/demetra-ignatiou), but they are pleased with the results, in particular the [downstairs](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/works) combination of tiled floor, a rolled-up red carpet and a copper fountain. Andre is struck by the proliferation of mundane tasks around the pursuit of sublime ends.\r\n\r\nOn the [opening day](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/opening-day) the artist [walks visitors through the exhibition](https://vimeo.com/195937348) in the company of [Aram Moshayedi](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/aram-moshayedi), a curator at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. [Late that evening](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/stories-from-the-lives-of-my-friends-party) there is music from the Berlin DJs [Steev Lemercier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbx4Cgl39Vw) and [Philip Wiegard](http://www.philipwiegard.com/), hosted by Christos Kyriakides.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday 4 April Christodoulos Panayiotou presents *Dying on Stage*, an evolving [reading-performance](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/dying-on-stage) in which the dancer Jean Capeille executes the *La Bayadere*, a piece choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev shortly before he died. The independent curator [Pierre Bal-Blanc](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/pierre-bal-blanc) responds. The exhibition continues until 8 May, when a portion of the works are transported to Venice to be included in Christodoulos Panayiotou’s solo show in the [Cyprus Pavilion](http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/2015/05/venice-christodoulos-panayiotou-at-the-cyprus-pavilion/) of the 2015 Biennale. \r\n\r\nOn 9 March Point hosts a joint book launch for [*Cypriot Cinemas*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/cyprus-cinemas) and [*Photography and Cyprus*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/photography-and-cyprus:-time,-place-and-identity).\r\n\r\n22 May, Point hosts [Point–Eleneio exhibition](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/point-elenion-exhibition) in the upstairs gallery. It is the outcome of an ongoing collaboration with the neighbouring elementary school [Eleneio](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/eleneio), a school where few of the pupils have contact with art. [The Point–Eleneio project](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/point--eleneion-project) began in October 2014, having [Chrystalleni Loizidou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/chrystalleni-loizidou) as project leader and is largely funded by a grant from the EEA (European Economic Area). An [Information Package](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/point--eleneion-project/information-package) on good arts education practices was also  produced and disseminated online. Regularly [hosting the children from Eleneio](https://vimeo.com/164249420) in its galleries, Point treasures the partnership.\r\n\r\nBetween 22 May and 28 June there is an [open-call](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/open-call) exhibition titled [*Fragments: Thoughts and Expressions of Art Education Processes*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/a-research-installation-in-progress) that draws attention to visual art education at every level in Cyprus. The exhibition is installed in cooperation with [Evanthia Tselika](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/evanthtia-tselika) from the University of Nicosia. Point’s ambition is to engender a more radical approach to art in Cypriot classrooms. Inevitably, Point becomes drawn into a wider debate about educational reform in Cyprus and beyond. Meanwhile, Cyprus still does not have an art school. \r\n\r\nOn 22 and 23 May Point holds an international [conference](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/contemporary-museum-gallery-education-practices-local-communities-meet-global-narratives) on contemporary museum and gallery education in collaboration with the University of Nicosia. The question is *How can gallery and museum education programmes meaningfully address the needs of the local community?* [Participants](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/media/00274.pdf) come from around the world. *Local communities meet global narratives*, a [report](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/report-esther-sayers) written by the artist, gallery educator and lecturer at Goldsmiths University [Esther Sayers](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/esther-sayers) commends disturbed hierarchies and the quality of the refreshments and concludes with remarks on kinship. For Point the most meaningful part of the project remains its relationship with the children of Eleneio. \r\n\r\n30 May, the young academic [Maria Tsangari](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/maria-tsangari) delivers a based on her paper [*Harry Potter and the Matricidal Prince*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/presentation-excerpt), connecting the themes of J.K. Rowling’s series to Greek tragedy. The author [Maria A. Ioannou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/maria-aioannou) leads a [creative writing workshop](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/workshop) on the theme.\r\n\r\n9 June, Point holds the launch of [*Its Water: Taps and Sources of Nicosia*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/publication-launch), a project by [Kyriaki Costa](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/kyriaki-costa) that proposes the ‘mapping of a city through the reactivation of inactive channels of water supply’.\r\n\r\nBetween 18 and 24 June Point is once more the joint host with the Ministry of Education and Culture, Brave New Media and Theatro Ena of [*Images and Views of Alternative Cinema*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/cyprus-alternative-cinema-festival).\r\n\r\nOver July Point hosts the [*First Annual Cyprus Circle*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/first-annual-cyprus-circle), a series of four [debates](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/debate-i) and an exhibition initiated by a group of young professionals with the aim of inspiring fresh thought around the issues arising from the Cyprus problem, i.e. the de facto partition of the island between the Greek-Cypriots in the South and the Turkish-Cypriots in the North. The debates adopt the [Oxford format](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/debates): there is a motion and two teams, one for, one against. \r\n\r\nAmong those taking part are members of the [Cypriot Puzzle](http://www.thecypriotpuzzle.org/ελάτε-να-το-λύσουμε-ηaydi-cozelim/), a group that aims to encourage engagement through clarity. They use Point’s resources to make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCy6FmugZV7Wo93ubbflhFvcnQRJKBMF_) and [infographics](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/people-of-cyprus) to explain the various problems facing Cyprus and how young people can get involved.   \r\n\r\nAccording to official sources, August 2015 marked the end of the [recession in Cyprus](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/07/cyprus-and-capital-controls), yet most Cypriots believe that the island will not thrive until it is united.\r\n\r\nAugust 2015: Summer in Cyprus is relatively brief this year. \r\n\r\nIn late August, [Dexter Sinister](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/dexter-sinister) – the designers Stuart Bertolotti-Bailey and David Reinfurt – visit Cyprus for a week to consider Point Centre’s new website. Stuart describes the extended session as ‘both industrious and relaxed’. ‘We spent most of the time in and out of the air conditioning, with a couple of excursions to Point when necessary,’ he writes. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing the backstory and the recent history of Point, Stuart, David and Andre decide that the website should be updated with a new bulletin every year, loosely adopting the format of an annual report. This conceit is reflected in the building itself with a metal sign above the front door indicating the year, an image of which is used as the online cover of the report. Made by a local workshop, the signs are in keeping with others in Nicosia. \r\n\r\nThe website is backdated to 2013, which means that the first two signs – 2013 and 2014 – operate retrospectively, while the third – 2015 – appears toward the end of that period. \r\n\r\nIn discussion with Stuart and David, the writer [Emily King](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/emily-king) chooses the present tense and an intimate tone for the reports. She aims to be [candid](http://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/candid) about the institution’s ups and downs, while celebrating its achievements. \r\n\r\nThe new season kicks off in September. On 17 September Point hosts a special screening within the context of the [First Cypriot VHS Festival](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/first-cypriot-vhs-festival) organised by Cypriot Berlin-based artist [Constantinos Taliotis](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/constantinos-taliotis).  \r\n\r\nFrom 15 October until early December the Berlin-based artist [Gerry Bibby](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/gerry-bibby) and the Greek curator [Evangelia Ledaki](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/evangelia-ledaki) take up residencies at Point. Chosen in consultation with Jacob Fabricius, the artist describes his work as [‘often aggressively fragile’](http://akademirommet.khio.no/plus-one/). Meanwhile, the curator claims an interest in the study of contemporary art through the comparative approach of anthropology and psychoanalysis.\r\n\r\nAndre discovers that, in offering residencies, you don’t only host the work, but also the person. The six weeks are intense for all concerned. \r\n\r\nFor Gerry they result in a series of [three public sessions](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/312) over which he [reads](…) his entire novel [*The Drumhead*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/the-drumhead) and a sculpture exhibition [*Yes No Future*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/yes-no-future), which opens on 27 November and remains on show for a week. Gerry’s sculptures are made from ordinary construction materials and derive from conversations with Cypriots about the island’s economic problems and the division between the north and south.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Evangelia embarks on a series of [studio visits with local artists leading to an open discussion](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/studio-visits-and-open-discussion) at Point on 18 November. Visiting 24 artists over three days, her process is democratic, but her conclusions verge on being blunt. On 4 December she presents the work of her long-time associate, the Greek artist [Petros Moris](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/petros-moris), and on the 5th she hosts [a solo presentation](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/solo-presentation) of the Cypriot painter [Vassilis Christofi](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/vassilis-christofi), a young artist she discovers during her studio visits. Evangelia will write a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/those-that-break) about her experience that Andre hopes might generate fresh thought about the purpose of artists’ residencies.\r\n\r\n8 December, [*Draftsmen’s Congress: Life Zone – Life Point*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/draftsmen-congress-life-zone-life-point), an ongoing project by the Polish artist [Pawel Althamer](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/pawel-althamer), opens both at Point and at the nearby [A. G. Leventis Gallery](http://www.leventisgallery.org/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/49). The exhibition is produced in collaboration with the [DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art](http://deste.gr), a private foundation owned by the Cypriot-born Athens-based art collector [Dakis Ioannou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/dakis-ioannou).\r\n*Draftsmen’s Congress* was first presented at the [7th Berlin Biennale](http://blog.berlinbiennale.de/en/projects/draftmen´s-congress-initiated-by-pawel-althamer-20163) in 2012. Starting with an empty room with white walls, the artist invites everyone to ‘create, engage and converse using images rather than words’. Visitors are encouraged to respond to politics, religion and current events in a non-verbal way. The artist believes that this process breaks down hierarchies and enables both bonding and debate.\r\n\r\nAndre describes Pawel’s approach as ‘nomadic activism’ and notes that he deploys his art-world privilege in a particularly powerful fashion. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition closes on 8 February 2016.',NULL),(7,1,'2015-08-28 05:49:03','2017-06-03 17:03:58',NULL,'To the Point Debate',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'to-the-point-debate',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Thursday 9 July, 20.00h','Will a Truth Commission Investigating the 1963–74 Atrocities Help or Hinder Current Solution Attempts of the Cyprus Problem?',''),(8,1,'2015-08-28 05:50:22','2016-01-11 17:51:40',30,'Education',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'education',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',''),(9,1,'2015-09-24 15:52:24','2016-01-19 17:06:45',NULL,'Grand Opening',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'grand-opening',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Wednesday, 22 Jul 20.00h','*Grand Opening* Exhibition of Projects and Initiatives Undertaken by Members of the First Annual Cyprus Circle',''),(10,0,'2016-01-12 14:33:45','2016-02-11 10:07:39',50,'2016',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11,1,'2016-01-13 18:48:34','2016-01-18 20:23:48',NULL,'Event 1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'event-1',NULL,'2012-01-12 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'This one is just a test.',NULL),(12,1,'2016-01-13 18:48:51','2016-01-13 18:50:19',NULL,'Event 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'event-2',NULL,'2012-02-14 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13,1,'2016-01-13 18:49:08','2016-01-13 18:50:41',NULL,'Event 3',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'event-3',NULL,'2012-03-30 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14,1,'2016-01-18 17:05:40','2017-04-28 17:29:40',24,'CATALOGUE',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'showoff',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nA publication recording the exhibition project *Show Off*, implemented by Point Centre for Contemporary Art and Malmö Konsthall in 2012. \r\n\r\n50 pp | English, Greek, Swedish | full colour | 34 x 24 cm | soft cover\r\n',NULL),(15,1,'2016-01-18 20:25:51','2016-01-18 20:25:51',40,'This event has a name',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'this-event-has-a-name',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16,1,'2016-02-01 15:12:46','2017-10-13 15:20:05',1,'MICHAEL ANASTASSIADES',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'michael-anastassiades',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Michael Anastassiades](http://michaelanastassiades.com) (b. 1967, Cyprus) was trained as a civil engineer at London’s Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine before earning an MA in Industrial Design at the Royal College of Art. \r\n\r\nIn 1994 he launched his studio and thereafter he designed products for manufacturers including FLOS, Puiforcat, Lobmeyr and Svenskt Tenn.

His creative approach follows a reductive process that removes any excess information and distils the essence of the object. His work is both functional and conceptual : it addresses practical and emotional needs while suggesting a multi-layered reading of symbolic associations.\r\n\r\n*Reload the Current Page* explores what Anastassiades calls the ‘contemporary anxieties of the modern Cypriot’. In this installation he celebrates the optimised freedom of creative expression offered by the gallery space, while remaining faithful to his design principles of subtraction, complexity and simplicity. Inspired by natural landscapes and cutting-edge technology, Anastassiades creates a series of objects embodying personal experiences and anxieties. Materials, forms and [titles allude to the sociopolitical](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/titles) events that have recently defined Cypriot society and, at the same time, suggest more symbolic, nuanced connections; the artist amplifies the ambiguity evoked by his objects, which remain free from any nostalgic or didactic references.\r\n\r\nAnastassiades experiments with a variety of stones from the [local geological landscape](http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/gsd/gsd.nsf/All/CE3B2485DC97BB83C22572A3004645C9/$file/Geological%20Map%20Cyprus_en.jpg?OpenElement), such as diabase and sandstone, which he pairs with bronze, glass and wood, materials that are often present in his work. Basic geometric forms like the sphere are constantly used as metaphoric references.\r\n\r\nRealistic sculptural landscapes, miniaturised geomorphological elements and glowing glass spheres compose a new scenery that the visitor is invited to experience at multiple levels. *Reload the Current Page* is more an invitation than a command – an invitation to embrace the versatility of the structures and to approach them in a meditative mood, to re-examine them and re-appropriate them.',NULL),(18,0,'2016-02-03 15:44:55','2016-04-11 13:23:53',NULL,'Î”Î™Î†Î¡ÎšÎ•Î™Î‘ ÎˆÎšÎ˜Î•Î£Î—Î£',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'gr',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'31.01.2014 - 26.04.2014\r\n\r\nΠρόγραμμα\r\n\r\nΠαρασκευή 31 Ιανουαρίου 2014\r\n\r\n7:00μμ Εγκαίνια\r\nΣάββατο 1 Φεβρουαρίου 2014\r\n\r\n11:00πμ Συζήτηση με το συγγραφέα/επιμελητή Justin McGuirk και τον Μιχάλη Αναστασιάδη\r\n\r\n1:00μμ Συζήτηση στρογγυλής τραπέζης\r\nΜιχάλης Αναστασιάδης, Hélène Binet - αρχιτεκτονική φωτογραφία, Justin McGuirk - συγγραφέας/επιμελητής, Omar Sosa – καλλιτεχνικός διευθυντής, graphic designer, εκδότης του Apartamento\r\n\r\nΘα προσφερθούν ροφήματα και ελαφρύ μεσημεριανό πριν από τη συζήτηση \r\n\r\nΠέμπτη 27 Φεβρουαρίου 2014\r\n\r\n6:30μμ Παρουσίαση του καταλόγου Reload the Current Page. \r\n\r\nΤο Point Centre for Contemporary Art φιλοξενεί για τους προσεχείς τρείς μήνες την πρόσφατη δουλειά του Μιχάλη Αναστασιάδη Reload the Current Page.Πρόκειται για εγκατάσταση αντικειμένων με εννοιολογικό υπόβαθρο τα οποία δημιουργήθηκαν ειδικά για την ατομική έκθεση του καλλιτέχνη στην Κύπρο.\r\n\r\nΗ δουλειά του Αναστασιάδη χαρακτηρίζεται από μια κομψή απλότητα που εμπερικλείει ποιητικές και φιλοσοφικές προεκτάσεις, επιτυγχάνοντας να ισορροπεί ανάμεσα στην τέχνη και το design. Η δημιουργική προσέγγιση του καλλιτέχνη βασίζεται σε μια αφαιρετική διαδικασία μέσα από την οποία απομακρύνεται κάθε τι περιττό και διυλίζεται η ουσία του αντικειμένου.

She selects the variables that she believes to be most pertinent to the issue at hand and maps their correspondence with one another according to the available evidence. These relationships are then used to predict a spectrum of potential future outcomes. Economists ignore complexity. They have to. It would be impossible to include all possible factors in their paradigms. They abstract, smooth away and scale down the real world in order to present it as, to some extent, predictable. \r\n\r\nEvery economic model is riddled with bias. There is no neutral method for selecting the relevant factors. The other-things-being-equal assumption on which all such schemes are founded requires an act of self-deception. These models are made to determine policy, but perhaps there is also psychological motivation behind their reductions. In ignoring messy reality in favour of making neat mock ups economists find ways of managing our and their anxieties.\r\n\r\nAn economist’s model has something in common with a dolls’ house or a miniature railway. It is an approximation of the real world that allows its creator to have a sense of control. Children test their ideas about the world by playing God both with dolls and latterly digital characters. Likewise adults who find the world difficult to comprehend can find refuge in elaborate train sets. In his book The Savage Mind, published in 1962, the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss argued “the intrinsic value of a small-scale model is that it compensates for the renunciation of sensible dimensions by the acquisition of intelligible dimensions.”\r\n\r\nA Japanese suiseki rock could find a place within a model railway or near a dolls’ house, but the impulse behind its school of miniaturisation is different. Suiseki rocks are selected for their resemblance to other, usually larger scale natural features such as mountain ranges or islands, but the relationships are suggestive not exact. There is a huge range of different categories of suiseki including not only rocks that look like mountains close up - kinzan-seki - and mountains in the distance – enzan-seki – but also those that bring to mind waterfalls – yamagata-taki-ishi – caves – dokutsu-ishi – and even fish – uogata-ishi or birds – torigata-ishi. Suiseki are not made or modelled, rather they are recognised. A suiseki is not a simplification, it is kind of analogy. It prompts meditation on what one form might reveal about another. \r\n\r\nThe central piece in Michael Anastassiades’s exhibition ‘Reload the Current Page’ is titled ‘Jimbutsu-seki’, which is the name for a suiseki stone that evokes the form of a human body. Unlike a suiseki, however, this piece was crafted not discovered. It is carved from black basalt, a volcanic stone common in Cyprus, according to the dimensions of the Pentadaktylos mountain mass, part of the Kyrenia mountain range that runs parallel to the northern coast of the island. Consisting of five finger-like projections, Pentadaktylos is the best-known section of the Kyrenia mountains to the extent that it is often taken to be synonymous with the entire range. Its resemblance to a hand has generated numerous myths and it is variously said to be a handful of earth that was flung at or pushed toward an enemy or the handprint of the island’s saviour has he emerged from the sea. These myths have accrued resonance in the last forty years, since when the mountains have been in the Turkish side of the island, yet have remained highly visible from the Greek. Pentadaktylos can be seen from the island’s divided capital Nicosia.\r\n\r\nMichael Anastassiades was a child when Cyprus was partitioned in 1974. He grew up in the shadow of the conflict and as a young adult served 24 months in the military – the period that remains compulsory for Greek Cypriot men - imagining various conflict scenarios. Had he remained living in Cyprus he would be obliged to keep a gun in his home to use against invaders. For Michael, as for many of his compatriots, Pentadaktylos loomed large both literally and figuratively. It was as if the island was waving at them from beyond enemy lines. \r\n\r\nThe Greek-Turkish conflict remains live, but times have changed. Currently the Cypriots’ most pressing concern is the state of the island’s finances. Yet somehow one crisis has merged into another and national anxieties have become non-specific. In taking the emotionally resonant and physically reminiscent form of Pentadaktylos and scaling it down, Michael has made an emblem for all of the islanders’ concerns. ‘Jimbutsu-seki’ embodies both the Greek Cypriots’ fears of invasion and their unease about economic collapse. While the act of miniaturisation and simplification usually implies some kind of manageability, in this case of worries are represented, perhaps even mitigated some, but the underlying problems remain stubbornly unsolved. \r\n\r\nWhile the landscape represented at in ‘Jimbutsu-seki’ has a basis in physical reality, that suggested by another of the pieces in the exhibition ‘Economic Sentiment Indicator’ is purely imaginary. Following the line of a graphic representation of the Cypriots’ perception of their economic state from 2008 to 2013, the piece was CNC[computer numerically controlled]-carved from sandstone. The chart on which it was based is striking. In line with global sentiment economic optimism in Cyprus plummeted in late 2008, then it held on and even rallied a little, only to plunge dramatically in mid 2011 during the time of the Greek government’s debt crises. From there the fall is pretty steady until the first quarter of 2013. On 25th March 2013 the Cypriot government accepted a ten-billion euro international bailout that came with a number of extremely stern conditions. Many ordinary Cypriots lost a significant proportion of their savings. At that point, unsurprisingly, Cypriot economic sentiment took a nosedive. \r\n\r\nMichael’s miniature three-dimensional graph of this tumult is a lovely thing. In spite of plotting financial woes, it looks like a model of a place you might want to spend your holidays. A boom becomes a hill you could clamber up and a recession a valley you could roll into. As yet there are no suiseki categories for the representation of emotional states, but such a thing doesn’t seem unfeasible. There are certain sorts of rocks that imply pattern or texture – for example tori-ishi, a stone that resembles a tiger pelt, or raiko-seki, a stone that suggests a lightening bolt. Why not a stone that brings to mind optimism or gloom?\r\n\r\nCyprus has a serious long-term problem with its water supply. This has been exacerbated by lack of cooperation and in some cases outright competition between the Greek and Turkish sections of the island. With both sides competing to tap scarce underground streams, there is even talk of a ‘water war’. The proposed solution on the Greek side is desalination plants and on the Turkish an undersea pipe bringing fresh water from mainland Turkey. Both will be expensive and difficult to engineer. In the meantime Cypriots monitor the level of water in their existing reservoirs obsessively and anxiously. Kouris is the largest dam on the island and it creates a reservoir that collects water from four different rivers. In good times this is a ‘Y’ shape, stretching deep into the valleys in the north, but in moments of drought it is reduced to a small uncertain ‘l’.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of expressing this perpetual concern, Michael has made three ‘water tables’. Their titles are a series of dates – ‘150321011’, ‘15032012’ and ‘15032013’ – and the surface area of each table is a to-scale representation of the Kouris reservoir on those three days carved in Cypriot sandstone. The dates mark the various stages in Cyprus’s economic crisis: March 2011 was a critical month in the Greek government’s debt crises that sent a shudder down the Cypriot spine, in March 2012 Cyprus’s credit rating was reduced to Junk status and March 2013 was the month of the aforementioned international bailout and the imposition of its punishing conditions. Between 2011 and 2013 the economic situation in Cyprus only got worse, but by contrast the water reserves actually improved. In 2011 the Kouris reservoir was reduced to a thin ribbon but by 2013 it had more than doubled in size. The tables are respectively 1.164 meters and 1.9 meters long. The relationship between natural and economic resources is of constant concern of economists. Notably famines are less likely the outcome of bad harvests, than of poor distribution, inequality and corruption. Cyprus’s need for water is unarguable, but rain alone cannot solve the problem. In order to reach an effective and lasting solution, the islanders must address the political and economic dimensions of the problem. \r\n\r\nWhile Cypriots worry about water, they distract themselves with football. The British introduced the sport to the island in the early 20th Century and Cyprus’s football league was founded in the early 1930s. Since then it has become the island’s consuming passion, so much so that the idea that football is merely entertainment would be an anathema to many Cypriot fans. Some teams are allied to political parties and the sense that supporters are siding with the right or the left adds heat to the competition. The island’s teams have enjoyed triumphs that are disproportionate to their resources, with the most successful of them all APOEL reaching the Champions League competition several times. \r\n\r\nMichael evokes this enthusiasm through the titles of two of the pieces in the exhibition: ‘Keepie Uppie’ and ‘Foul’. Both are CNC-carved sandstone models of a series of hills that drivers see en route between Nicosia and Larnaca airport, which has served as the island’s major airport since the Turkish invasion put the newly constructed Nicosia air terminal out of action forty years ago. ‘Keepie Uppie’ is simply a 1.5-meter long representation of a series of peaks, ‘Foul’, meanwhile, is a model of three peaks on two of which, in reality, sit a church and United Nations military outpost. Instead of modeling these features in the piece, however, Michael has placed an opaline sphere in the valley between the three hills. Again there is a suggestion of suiseki. Football fans channel life’s messy tapestry of joy and despair through a single simple channel. By connecting the peaks and troughs of the island’s landscape with the notion of sporting and political fortune, he implies that the sentiments of the football supporter might be more complex than they appear. \r\n\r\nThe most personal of all the pieces in this exhibition are Large Zap and Small Zap. Both approximate spheres made from rough Cypriot stone, they are respectively 300mm and 45mm in diameter. When Michael was a teenager his father commissioned a house from Cyprus’s most respected architect Neoptolemos Michaelides. Born on the island in 1921, Michaelides studied in Milan both immediately before and after the Second World War and he is known for combining austere modernist form with local craft traditions. Michaelides became a mentor to Michael and the two of them would make outings to look at architectural and geological sites. On one such trip, Michaelides handed Michael a stone that was a near-perfect sphere, which Michael has kept to this day. This same stone is Small Zap while Large Zap is the same thing scaled up several times. The larger the form becomes, the more apparent it is that it’s not quite spherical. \r\n\r\nWhile reduction and simplification are used to render things manageable - from economic relationships to train networks – magnification is employed to create complexity and reveal hidden truths. It is all a matter of perspective and proportion. It’s all about scale. Significantly in this exhibition Michael reduces the features of Cyprus as a whole, but enlarges the small piece of the island that he has kept as a souvenir these past 25 years. It’s interesting that he feels safe to expand and explore his personal connection with Michaelides, but, when it comes to the state of the nation, he feels the need for reduction and containment. \r\n',NULL),(27,1,'2016-02-22 11:13:47','2017-10-13 12:21:21',21,'EMILY KING',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'emily-king',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\nEmily King received her MA from London\'s Royal College of Art and completed a PhD at Kingston University.\r\n\r\nShe is a [writer and curator](http://www.itsnicethat.com/features/history-in-the-making-emily-king-looks-back-on-20-years-of-writing-design-history) with an interest in graphic design.

It is a two-way project between Bauer and the staff at the organisation. Documenting one week in the life of the organisation, the film takes their daily activities as a springboard for a visual discussion on feminism, politics and aesthetics in today\'s society. The film departs from questions posed in the 1970s Women\'s Liberation Movement (particularly those explored by feminist film collectives from the time), and consequently focuses on issues the Southall Black Sisters claim are important for today\'s black and minority women.\r\n\r\nII. *Der Fall Joseph*\r\n\r\nPetra Bauer\'s video *Der Fall Joseph* starts at the point where the German media gave up on the story. The video deals with a tragedy that took place in the summer of 1997. A six year-old boy was found dead at a public swimming pool in East Germany. The boy\'s German mother and his Iraqi father suspected that their son did not drown but that a gang of neo-Nazis murdered him. As no one would believe them, they started their own inquiry using standard legal parlance and methodology in order to gain credence. Their inquiry was still in progress three years later when, in November 2000, the ‘Joseph Case’ became the subject of enormous publicity in the German media. There was speculation as to whether the family had, in fact, invented the murder theory themselves. The public prosecutor finally concluded that the boy had died of a latent heart disease and thus was not the victim of a neo-Nazi gang. The local officials could relax and claim that the prosecutor\'s conclusions showed that there were no neo-Nazi gangs in their town. *Der Fall Joseph* is constructed from ten different narratives: the family\'s, the prosecutor\'s, testimony from a witness, a police cross-examination, and excerpts from reports in the media and other sources. All of the narratives seem coherent, logical and credible, but they all differ markedly from each other. The only thing that everyone can agree on is that on the 13 June 1997 at ten to three in the afternoon a six year-old boy was found dead on the bottom of a swimming pool in a little town in East Germany. The complexity of the event becomes evident in the sense of frustration that grips viewers. With each successive narrative, we have the feeling we’re getting closer to the truth, but at the end, we’re left just as confused as when we started. Whose are the motives and aims that influence our own attitudes to the case and how can the law treat the matter objectively? With her video *Der Fall Joseph* Petra Bauer has chosen to emphasize the fact that subjective motives can contribute to creating an event and that an individual interpretation can become the accepted truth. Instead of blindly trying to establish the truth, her video discusses the entire process of looking back on a series of events and seeing how the choices made at the time underlie and influence the final result. \r\n\r\nIII. *Choreography for the Giants* \r\n\r\nIn *Choreography for the Giants*, which consists of a book and a film, Petra Bauer and Marius Dybwad Brandrud look at the procession known as the Mechelen Ommegang, or Mechelen Cavalcade, a world heritage event which only takes place every twenty-five years. The last time it happened was in 1988. Since then Belgian society has undergone many changes. The artists concentrate on the production process of this edition of the Ommegang. They pay critical attention to the claim that the whole of Mechelen society is represented in the parade, particularly to the production of three new giant figures: an Arab, an African and an Asian.  Who is being represented, by whom and on what conditions? *Choreography for the Giants* was produced by Contour 2013 and curated by Jacob Fabricius as part of a collaboration with the biennials of Göteborg, Liverpool and Ljubljana (within the framework of the European Culture Programme 2007–2013). \r\n\r\nIV. *Read The Masks. Tradition Is Not Given.*\r\n\r\n*Read the Masks. Tradition Is Not Given* is part of an ongoing project under the same title by artists Petra Bauer and Annette Krauss that investigates the Dutch tradition of Zwarte Piet (Black Pete) in the light of its social and political implications.\r\nThe film picks up from the artists\' proposed event for ‘Be(com)ing Dutch’, a two-year research project and exhibition at the Van Abbemuseum on issues concerning the Dutch national identity. It represents the artists’ response to the public reactions towards the event and is a development of the discussions it triggered.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n*Conversations: Stina Lundberg Dabrowski meets Petra Bauer*\r\n\r\nIn the videowork *Conversations: Stina Lundberg Dabrowski meets Petra Bauer* we see the artist Petra Bauer being interviewed by a famous Swedish reporter.

The Künstlerhaus exhibition is less concerned with the social happiness that a structure and its contents may signify, and more pleasurably associated with its flow of forms and metaphors, related, and not, to the artist’s family house, planned and never constructed. Vacant window ledges are seductively abstracted in a horizontal line (age) of plank wood, giving the piece its title, *7 Window Frames*. Entities belonging to a house are abstracted and placed in another time when they existed otherwise. Feather paddings quietly foster the history of a house in *A Second Try*, and enigmatic interiors weave remains of future memories in cabinets of curiosities. In the spaces of Künstlerhaus Bethanien, Panayiotis Michael gracefully evokes moods prompted by what we feel entitled to experience. The show generously offers a levelling kind of playground from which no one seems to be in a favourable position to grasp the boundaries of a house of entitlement. Perhaps, the lost dream house of the child is not imagined as an enduring house of the future but as small, passing gestures of tranquil moods, where we can renegotiate our entitlements.\r\n\r\n(From a text by Maria Petrides, 2013)\r\n\r\nNora Mayer, co-director of the Künstlerhaus Bethanien also wrote a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/booklet-text) which was published in the institution’s annual booklet.\r\n',NULL),(43,1,'2016-02-22 16:31:20','2016-05-23 14:51:03',68,'INSTALLATION VIEWS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'installation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(44,1,'2016-02-22 16:40:17','2017-05-30 22:59:49',70,'LOULI MICHAELIDOU',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'louli-michaelidou',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\nLouli Michaelidou studied Psychology at Indiana State University, USA, and holds a postgraduate degree in Social Psychology from the London School of Economics.

The format of the discussion was inspired by the concept of the ‘20 Questions’ game.\r\n\r\nI. In Wikipedia, ’20 Questions’ is described as an oral team game played inside that encourages deductive thinking. The players try to guess what is in the mind of the presenter, with a cognitive process moving from general to specific. This process can be useful in your case, Panayiotis, and perhaps your work in general, which is not descriptive or narrative (although your works often include a story). In contrast, upon entering the exhibition, we face an enigmatic environment. Let\'s begin, for example with this photograph, its story, as a natural work (*Photograph* – crochet and table).\r\n\r\nII. This concept of ‘transition’, literal or figurative, repeats harmoniously throughout your work. The in-between, the natural and the psychological stage of the ‘transition’ unavoidably brings a feeling of uncertainty about the present and the future, on a personal and collective level, which opposes the innate human need for certainty, stability and reassurance. Like we have all experienced many times in life, the instinctive reaction to this uncertainty is to plan or dream of what we consider will bring about a balance. Very often, of course, these plans, dreams and efforts may repeat and adjust constantly, without ever leading to the realisation of the goal. It is a Sysiphean effort. In relation to the above, consequently, I would ask you to talk to us about the collage work *Luxury home 41 H2* in Point\'s showcase.\r\n\r\nIII. The work *Seven window frames* contains a series of references which suggest several symbolisms – personal, social and political. It is also connected to your new work, *Architectural Drawing* (2014), exhibited currently at the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre. Talk to us about these symbolisms, your choice in materials and its production in Berlin and Cyprus. If you wish, we can also talk about its personal and cultural significance. \r\n\r\nIV. In her text for the initial exhibition at Bethanien, Maria Petrides referred to *The Poetics of Space* (Gaston Bachelard, 1958), whose ideas seem to accurately frame your technique towards an ‘architecture of imagination’. Bachelard opposes the ‘ideal’ architectural space of our dreams with the often less enchanting experience of the actual space, highlighting the discord between the temporary and the permanent. Explain to us the role of these concepts in the understanding and realisation of your work.\r\n\r\nV. The choice and direction of the objects in many of your works have an intensely surreal feel. *Speed fix* here and *Landscape* are very good examples, but there are many others. *Balloon* (2013, Berlin) comes to mind, a huge balloon blocking an entrance, as do *Under construction* (2003), where the exhibition space was transformed into a seemingly casual and unstable scaffolding; *You can count on me* (beam + radio) (2010), an older version of the work, and *A second try*, upstairs, where a column seems to be based on a radio. They all look like absurd images, paradoxical, weak, incomplete, like the ones we encounter in our dreams; as if they reflect the everyday anxiety as it is imprinted on our unconscious, the ungratified and fragile desire, the reaction of thought and emotion when they is not expressed. On a conscious level, these images may hold more political meanings, becoming, for example, a commentary about the melancholy of the conventional dream and the irony or illusion of certainty (let\'s say, in relation to a belief, an identity, a culture) where the effort to understand imposes a degradation. If we attempted to make up an arbitrary or ‘pompous’ version of historical terms, we would be able to speak of ‘conceptual surrealism’. The surrealists, of course, developed the well-known psychoanalytical methodology, with dream analysis at its centre, in order to liberate human thought and imagination from false rationalism and social convention. Surrealism, as we all know, was a movement promoting a social, cultural and political revolution. A psychoanalytic analysis would then lead, I believe, to a very interesting interpretation of your work. Have you ever made this connection consciously? How have these two works, *Speed Fix* and *Landscape*, come about?\r\n\r\nVI. What does *Golden*, the mathematical formula on the wall, represent?\r\n\r\nVII. *Fence* – Faced with this work, we could focus on two points: a. the imitation of the function of the DIY and the collective process behind the production of a lot of your work, and b. the repeated concept of the boundary, the limitation, which may start from the individual and interpersonal, and continue on to the social, political and national. This approach of the ‘boundary’ concept, the cognitive, emotional or actual, undoubtedly connects with a psychosocial process involving specific cultural extensions about the Cypriot ‘idiosyncrasy’ and reality. This process again includes the ‘absurd’. What are your thoughts about this?\r\n\r\nVIII. The titles of your works have from the beginning been indicative of their attitude,  themes and conceptual natures: *Under construction*, 2003; *I am innocent* (γονείς) 2004; *The dreams I still have for us*, 2005; *Remember me*, 2005; *Σου Υπόσχομαι να μ\' αγαπάς για πάντα*, 2005; *Ουρανέ, όχι δεν θα πω το ναι*, 2010; *You can count on me* (beam + radio), 2010; *Luxury homes*, 2013; *Episode 2: Sabotage*, 2013, etc. They generally express an intention and a position opposite the absurdity of our relationship with ourselves, the paradox of human relationships, the hypocrisy of social conventions, the emptiness of political speech. They are filled with self-sarcasm and irony, but also poetic melancholy, borrowing from childlike magical thinking. You have constructed in several exhibition spaces poles that float in the air. From where does this obsession stem? \r\n\r\nIX. Let\'s remain on the titles a little longer because they are very interesting, but also because they are a necessary part of the conceptual work. The title of the exhibition, *Entitled*, may have several interpretations. Why did you choose it? (It suggests, for example, ownership, a right or a privilege. It may concern human emotion, experience, dreams or social commodity, an opinion, a position or a revolution).\r\n\r\nX. This work, in contrast with the title of the exhibition, is called *Untitled* (white flag). It is a work which, through its simplicity and subtraction of image, seems to make an especially intense and clear political statement that is not moralistic or imposing, but subtle and open to interpretation (general or specific). You had mentioned that for you this work has ‘sound’. \r\n\r\nXI. It is relevant to our discussion, I think, to wonder about the more general attitude and form that what is considered ‘political work’ in Cyprus is taking. One of my own observations is that, at least in Greek Cypriot consciousness, these formulas occur: POLITICAL = NATIONAL (that is, something which involves mainly the Cyprus Problem, and rarely any other political subjects, such as gender, class, sexual orientation, immigration, the environment, etc., which have historically been put on the fringe). As a consequence, POLITICAL ART = CYPRUS PROBLEM (where most works project ideological and nationalistic positions, reinforced by the dominant narratives of national identity and the Greek Cypriot ‘national trauma’, often echoing a rhetorical propaganda). Finally, the GREEK CYPRIOT TRAUMA = SOCIAL VALIDATION (this is observed within the local art environment as well as at the wider cultural, educational, political and social level). Your own approach, shared with some other artists, seems to move against the conventional thought structure and to systematically question the dominant narratives around identity, ‘nation’, the ‘Cyprus Problem’ and other matters (e.g. *Ode to joy* (6-hour performance, stitching EU borders on map, sound of mixed national anthems); *Geography test* (1998-2000, interactive installation with flags); *Sale* (Alexandria Biennale 1999, sale of flags or rails), and *Ttoppin* (2012, In Crisis). I am under the impression that Chuz Martinez (curator of the Cyprus Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2005, in which you took part with Constantia Sofokleous, and more recently the head of the curating team of Documenta 13), was one of the first critics to locate this subtle and simultaneously penetrative handling of the ‘political’ in your work, and the first to refer to ‘fluidity’, the ‘debateable nature’ of identity, and the ‘criticism of the present’, within the context of the Cypriot national participation. These concepts were analysed further of course in later texts, for example in those of Maria Petrides, Nora Mayr and others. Do you believe that such readings have an effect on the wider Cypriot audience, or is there more of an aesthetic evaluation of your work and generally of works that exercise criticism?\r\n\r\nXII. The ‘weak’ architecture, the absurd spaces/settings, and the crushing of boundaries between private and public were themes that you tackled especially intensely in your research for the Venice Biennale. These recur in your work and develop from drawings or collages in animation films such as *Luxury home 41 H1* (video-connected to the collage). Describe for us the process of its production.\r\n\r\nXIII. Your relationship with architecture always leads to a utopian mind-frame, which according to Amerigo Nutolo, is penetrated by your ‘social and political vision’. We could refer here to the *Architecture and Utopia* of the Italian architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri (*Architecture and Utopia: Design and Capitalist Development*, 1973), who developed the critical theory of ‘architecture as ideology’. In summary, Tafuri argued that, since modern architecture has been used as a tool for the development of capitalism, it is not in a position to contribute to social change. Later dismissing (in *The Sphere and the Labyrinth*, 1980) the classic interpretation of the ideology as ‘false consciousness’, considering it contradictory, he moved on to a perception of ideologies as delirious representations in the Foucaultian sense, while at the same time making an important connection with Freud and psychoanalysis. There was an acknowledgement that ideologies as well as depictions function on a subconscious level, and it is here that the term ‘imaginative / fantastical architecture’ made an entrance. In other words, we have on the one hand the Marxist sense of architecture as a commodity, and on the other hand the Freudian sense of it as dream. What, I think, makes Tafuri\'s critique still relevant and current is the realisation that the responsibility of the intellectual (historian, philosopher, critic, artist) is not to transform a false consciousness into a true one, but to help towards the development of understanding and social consciousness. How are these ideas relative locally—if they are—to your applications in the series *Luxury homes* and in other works?\r\n\r\nXIV. (Wherever relevant) the research of the social anthropologist Vasos Argyrou focuses on the concept of symbolic domination in the Cypriot mind. This refers to the ways in which Cypriots, even before the Imperial era, connected themselves to a specific sense of identity which could only be complete by relating to a ‘superior’ and ‘objective’ entity called the West. This has morphed into a dominant cultural direction that passes through the Greek Cypriot narrative especially. Returning to the metaphor of Sisyphus, the persistent efforts to ‘occupy’ this identity are doomed to constant failure since they revolve around an illusion / utopia, that is, the taking of the West as a tangible homogenic object. According to Argyrou and other theorists, this has been an obstacle to Cypriots in pondering and handling their colonial and postcolonial situation. I believe that this is symptomatic also within the context of contemporary Cypriot art. \r\n\r\nXV. Your technique extends from the area of drawing, installation and photography to the area of performance, theatre, etc. Beyond the participatory process hiding behind many of your works, in the last 10 years you have also co-founded and acted through artist collectives (Artrageous group, 2004-5; pick nick projects, 2012), which promote collective projects centred around social involvement and sensitisation. In her 2012 book *Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship*, Claire Bishop explores the ‘social turn’ of art in the West, distinguishing three historical moments of political disturbance which guided art movements towards social change: the historical avant-garde around 1917 and the self-titled ‘neo avant-garde’ of 1968. The recurrence of participatory art during the ‘90s is closely connected to Europe and the fall of communism in 1989. Bishop approaches this third reference not just as a turn but as a return to the social field (‘turn to the social = return to the social’).

[The Listening Group Sessions A+B](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/the-listening-group): The term ‘listening group’ is playing with the idea of the ‘reading group’. What a reading group does is read and discuss a book together. In the same way, the purpose of the listening group is to listen together and talk about what we listen to. The first two meetings, taking place at Point, will focus on contemporary music and electroacoustic composition and will introduce some basic ideas from contemporary composition and theory. The [first session](https://vimeo.com/195440463) will be introduced by Dr Andreas Vrahimis, who will briefly discuss the connection between philosophical discussions in the 20th century phenomenological tradition and the concept of acousmatic listening. The introduction will be followed by a presentation by Yiannis Christofides of a work by [Bernard Parmegiani](http://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/interviews/bernard-parmegiani_sound-thinking) that explores acousmatic listening. The [second session]() will involve a discussion by Christofides and Vrahimis of the work of the [Wandelweiser Group](http://www.wandelweiser.de/edition-w-w.html) in relation to conceptions of silence in music.\r\n\r\nIII. [Electric Soundscapes](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/electric-soundscapes) is a concert of works for electroacoustic media performed by members of the Hellenic Electroacoustic Music Composers Association (HELMCA), curated by Dr Katerina Tzedaki.\r\n\r\nIV.

Even in those cases where the assumption is not explicitly employed or theorised about, it is implicated in the situation in which this kind of music is listened to. Walk into any electroacoustic music concert and you will find an audience seated firmly in chairs, eyes wide shut, ears wide open. Acousmatic composers have long aspired to this, possibly utopian, dream of the pure ear, the ear that is pure thought, the ear of the mind rather than the ear as bodily organ. The ear qua res cogitans, not res extensa, rests on a problematic distinction between the mental representation of sound and its bodily existence. This reduction of audiences to listening subjects can be seen as the penultimate effect of what, via Attali,[2] we can call the ‘political economy’ of the concert hall, which renders its audience into immovable ‘subjects’ of a Cartesian theatre of representations passing before their ears.\r\n\r\nChristofides’ *The Blind Ear* partly steps out of the acousmatic framework by throwing its audience into a space. Having thus been thrown is to find one’s body in the midst of a region constituted and traversed by sonic quasi-objects.[3] Experiencing this work involves a process of being oriented and of disorienting. Where is the horizon? Can its existence be stipulated in relation to some sort of centre? To this latter question, *The Blind Ear* seems to allow us to answer both yes and no. In navigating this space, one may possibly be pulled by the ear towards a centre—the ‘sweet spot’ that is the Holy Grail of audiophiles. Here, standing (or sitting) still allows one to be constituted as a disembodied acousmatic subject. This quasi-Oedipal gesture can be thought of as ‘blinding’ one’s bodily ear. More importantly, however, there are also other trajectories to be followed in the spaces of this work, ones that resist various pulls towards centres or subjectifications.\r\n\r\n1. Schaeffer, P.

Point commissioned Binet to come to Cyprus and photograph the house, which was designed by Neoptolemos Michaelides and constructed in the mid-sixties.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition places the focus upon the outstanding work of Neoptolemos Michaelides, one of the key figures of architectural modernism in Cyprus, and simultaneously opens the discourse around it at an international level. Through the lens of Binet, the interior and exterior of the house that the architect and his artist wife resided in are reduced to the qualities and core values that characterised Michaelides’ working idiosyncrasy – nothing excessive, clear forms, simple but not simplistic, local traditional structural elements and materials in dialogue with modern elements and tendencies. Before setting up her heavy analogue cameras and beginning to structure her images, Binet spent time in and around the house, engaging in an intimate experience of the building and following a ritual-like procedure. Her frames emphasise the strong concept behind the residential building and highlight the qualities represented in its structural elements. Binet (re)introduces us to the world of the architect with images that trigger thinking processes and dreams and that invite us to reflect on the essence of things, a process that defined Michaelides’ working and living philosophy.\r\n\r\nBinet, who is internationally acknowledged as one of the world’s leading architectural photographers, has established her own personal style in this field over the past twenty-five years. She has developed a unique way of looking at buildings, penetrating to their core, capturing the values and truths that they encapsulate and exposing them in her photographs. The underlying theme in her work is the interplay of light, shadow and texture of materials and architectural elements. She has an extraordinary ability to orchestrate these three elements and reveal the power of the buildings she photographs. By choosing to focus on certain details, elements or lines, and to position them together in her frames, she initiates a dialogue between them. Thus, her work goes beyond documentation and is best described as a compositional process that articulates essential connections and associations. Her images present us with an experience of the building instead of a view. At the same time, they reveal the architect’s vision, which is often juxtaposed or distorted by the lived reality.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the Maria and Neoptolemos Michaelides Foundation.\r\n\r\nPoint will also host a series of exhibition-related initiatives: \r\n\r\nPetros Phokaides highlights architectural discourses imprinted in magazines and books found in Neoptolemos Michaelides’ abandoned architectural office at 39 Perikleous Street, in Nicosia, and initiates exchanges with historians and theorists of architecture in order to formulate critical perspectives across Michaelides’ work and post-war architectural culture.\r\n\r\npick nick became intrigued with the prospect of meeting and talking with Maro Yiakoumi, a former architectural designer who had worked with Neoptolemos Michaelides.

He was telling me about his childhood and this experience he had going to the house, which is closed, but so beautiful, in this very special part of the world – your special island. He said: “Hélène, you have to photograph the house!”.’\r\n\r\n(Hélène Binet)\r\n\r\nSo I had this wonderful intuition. As you know, many projects cannot be realized unless you have somebody ambitious and generous by your side. It was an honour for me to work with you, Andre, and be able to come here and photograph Neoptolemos’s house. For me, it was like going to a new culture, a new place – as I’ve never been here before – and producing such a special work. And it is so special because it’s Neoptolemos’s house: you enter a very private place, which he built for his own life, his dream, his wife, his work. Nothing is there anymore, but being able to go inside and photograph it was for me an interesting conversation. When I started, this conversation came very gently, with the realisation that two people had lived there, they were drinking coffee, looking outside… There was a tension, when I came to think about their normal life, their two chairs, their two *presences*. \r\n\r\nIt’s all about how you translate architectural space and the emotion involved. In my way of approaching things, it is always about silence. In architectural photography you sometimes have a great dilemma about how to represent this complex experience. I tend to say that I am not competing with this experience. \r\n\r\nLet me tell you some very small things: The first is to enter the architectural place, create your own view and maybe dream. This dream is space. It is very beautiful to think about the space you can create in your mind, like when you read a story in a book and have a space in mind. When you dream, you have space, and this space is only yours. \r\n\r\nSo I entered the house and had to select my view, then prepare the exhibition and make another selection of the works. Andre, Michael and I had the idea to bring ‘fresh air’. The dimension, the size was also important. Some part of the decision to use big prints seems to me almost like looking at a cut-out of this architecture on a wall of an environment that everyone can look at, anytime, without distinction. \r\n\r\nThe other dimension I wanted to bring into this exhibition was, of course, the material, the concrete. I think it is a warm, beautiful material that reacts to light. Another fantastic aspect of this house is that it is so full of light, and the selection of the photographs aimed to give this dimension of the articulation with light. We had all read some texts about how important the light was, but we also forgot this Japanese feeling, that you need obscurity and places of darkness. This articulation was also vivid through the staircase and the living room. Then, when you go upstairs, you embrace the full light, which is so beautiful. \r\n\r\nI therefore photographed small aspects of the house, but I couldn’t bring them all here. The photographs are small moments we can enjoy. We have this abstraction I was talking about in the beginning. I worked on film, which is very important for me, with heavy, big equipment. And photographing is for me like a performance: you are completely on your own when you work. The moment you find the photo you want, you say \'Yes!\', and you can’t change anything after that on your computer. While printing, you can handle the contrast – whether you prefer it lighter or darker, but that’s it. This is the way I work and I am happy about it.[...]',NULL),(56,1,'2016-02-23 11:26:08','2017-10-16 14:40:54',182,'PARALLEL READINGS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'parallel-readings',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br/>\r\nPress Release:\r\n\r\nPetros Phokaides revisits the abandoned library of Neoptolemos Michaelides’s desolate architectural office at 39 Perikleous Street in Nicosia aiming to gain insights into the architect’s creativity and to highlight its ties to post-war international architectural discourses.\r\n\r\nHis project involves the production of a volume comprised of selected notes, traces and bookmarks found inside some of the architect’s books, magazines, and key architectural publications of the post-war era. [A selection of this material will also be presented during the exhibition](https://vimeo.com/238067343). Transcending the fragmentary condition of the material – as the official archive remains inaccessible to researchers and the public – the project attempts to formulate critical perspectives across Michaelides’s work and the larger postwar architectural culture through a series of discussions with historians and theorists of architecture.\r\n\r\nThe architectural office and former family house of Neoptolemos Michaelides at 39 Perikleous Street in Nicosia was abandoned since the office closed in the early 1990s. The building and its contents were exposed to physical deterioration and most likely to theft for decades. Despite the considerable destruction, a significant number of architectural magazines and books remained on the shelves, but this important archival resource continued to be exposed to humidity, dust, and other forms of destruction. In light of these threats, some concerned individuals (architects Georgia Frangoudi, Aimilia Siandou and Petros Phokaides, and the visual artist Kyriakos Lyras) rescued the material by collecting what remained in the architectural library of the office. Upon collaboration with the Cyprus Architects Association, which was in charge of safeguarding the building, the material was transferred to the Mesarch Lab of the University of Cyprus’s Department of Architecture, which began to clean, catalogue and make efforts to preserve the material for future researchers.\r\n\r\nThe volume was produced with the collaboration of Georgia Frangoudi, Kyriakos Lyras and Alkis Hadjiandreou.\r\n\r\npick nick became intrigued with the prospect of [meeting and talking with Maro Yiakoumi](https://soundcloud.com/user-281493574/maro-yiacoumi-interviewed-by-pick-nick), a former architectural designer who had worked with Neoptolemos Michaelides.

These undoubtedly had a strong bearing on the formation of his own autonomous architectural process, as seen throughout his life’s work.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus, his legacy comprises a large number of important modern buildings dating back to the early 50s, each one a master class in poetic simplicity and honest structural expression. It is for these attributes that his architecture is greatly appreciated in his homeland. His true originality lay in the adaptation of indigenous building types and the use of natural, local materials to create something new. One of his most important completed buildings is residential: a house, designed and constructed in Nicosia during the mid-60s for himself and Maria, his artist wife. The project’s typology is a progressive variation of the residential types seen in his earlier work, but this particular building is a tour de force. The construction is subtle, the use of form both sophisticated and refined. The design approach is ‘critically regionalist’, a position that many architects would later adopt. \r\n\r\nThe project’s form and ‘gestures’ are dictated by the elongated site on which it rests. Upon seeing this villa for the first time, one soon experiences its power to transfix and wonders at its inherent beauty. It is a home like a Minoan palace: majestic and yet humble; complex yet beautifully plain. It appears almost to float above the horizon, cushioned softly in its verdant surroundings. The receding white walls and projected grey slabs create horizontal zones and give the space its human and generic scales, which titillate the eye. There is a regularity, a rhythm to its structure, and a refined, measured proportion to its composition.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting the variety at play across the villa’s three storeys. The parking spaces and guests’ living areas at ground level contrast with a far more reserved second floor, the piano nobile, the owners’ living quarters. The third floor, an isolated den for study, is crowned by a beautifully articulated parabolic vault, thus completing the villa\'s intrinsic classical components: base, torso, and crown. These are connected by flights of marble steps embedded in concrete that irrevocably draw any visitor to ascend, to experience the pure drama of the vertical space. Impressive collections of art and artefacts are seamlessly integrated into the domestic space. Patios and terraces penetrate or extend from the interiors to complement external conditions: the sun’s arc or a cool breeze.\r\n\r\nMaximum use was made of local materials, which have maintained their natural colour and texture. The building’s reinforced frame, walls and ceilings are fair-faced concrete. Their moulds were meticulously fashioned and sandblasted so that the finish reveals the rich pattern of the timber surface. The external cavity walls and internal partitions are hollow brick plastered with lime mortar and white marble sand, a traditional technique used to waterproof walls and vaulted Church roofs. There is not a single drop of paint used. \r\n\r\nNatural light pours in through carefully controlled openings, enlivening the fair-faced texture and transforming the interior into a relaxed, almost mystical space. It is worth noting the architect’s intelligent use of detail: the wooden balustrade, left in its natural form, which grows more beautiful with age; the double-faced artefact displays; the protruding concrete gutters, which became a trademark in Michaelides’s later work.  \r\n\r\nOn a theoretical level, the architect had no interest in elevations, as he once stated. The rational yet poetic plan formed the basis for his work. Things were made beautiful through honesty, refinement, and purity. This principle draws from modern philosophical, even oriental, thinking. Michaelides and his fascinating wife used to travel to Japan and Korea in the 60s, a rarity among Cypriots. For those fortunate enough to have known him, it was clear that the principles he applied to architecture and those he applied to everyday life were the same: his architectural philosophy was born out of his day-to-day experience, rather than any adherence to stylistic fashions. Looking more deeply at the structural elements of his work, one can easily draw a parallel to the structural principles of Le Corbusier’s Maison Domino and the Five Points of Modern Architecture, but then these manifestos and Michaelides’ work hail from similar times; times when a search for new ideas in the construction of reinforced concrete was the norm.

Zorba argues that at a time when the cultural landscape is being restructured, the welfare state is being cancelled, elites are being rearranged, cultural hierarchies are giving birth to social hierarchies and cultural biodiversity is being threatened, the need for a new paradigm of public cultural policy is urgent. Cultural policy isn’t aimed at the cultured minorities. However, museums, academies and art spaces remain, to a great extent, of exclusive use: curiosity, inquiry, informality, proximity, dialogue, testing and experimentation – all elements that characterise everyday life – do not find a place in those rooms where order prevails. How is it possible to overcome the old strict hierarchical structure of culture – which excluded, kept distances, and wasn’t in step with the everyday – so that it can benefit not just the elites, but also those at the margins? How can the participation of diverse groups in cultural processes and in the culture of everyday life be achieved? To conclude, what is this concept of ‘cultural democracy’?, and why is culture not merely a private matter? Finally, what does cultural policy in a post-colonial, post-war and fragmented society in a country like Cyprus look like, where the cultures of two other states serve as the main reference points?',NULL),(65,0,'2016-02-24 15:46:46','2016-02-24 15:47:00',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(66,0,'2016-02-25 15:06:05','2016-02-25 15:08:05',NULL,'Î£Ï…Î¶Î®Ï„Î·ÏƒÎ· Î³Î¹Î±',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'66',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(67,0,'2016-02-25 15:09:11','2016-02-25 19:04:55',NULL,'Î£Ï…Î¶Î®Ï„Î·ÏƒÎ· Î³Î¹Î±',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-abc-%CF%84',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'abcdefg',NULL),(68,1,'2016-03-01 12:56:01','2017-06-01 23:46:57',303,'MYRSINI ZORBA',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'myrsini-zorba',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Myrsini Zorba](http://mzorba.gr/wp/?p=605) graduated from the Athens University of Law and completed a postgraduate degree in Philosophy of Law from the University of Rome La Sapienza and holds a PhD in Political Sciences.\r\n\r\nShe taught theory and cultural politics in the postgraduate course *Cultural Organisations Management MSc*, HOU, 2007–2012.

In spite of knowing little about Cyprus, immediately I understood that such an initiative was essential. In our conversations I could see that Andree’s motivation was to intensify the level of artistic activity in Cyprus, and provide a platform where an already stimulating local scene could benefit from the encounters with international crowds. At the same time, Andree’s intention, it seemed to me, was to use POINT as a space in which the near and the distant would enter into a dialogue, especially through invitations to artists, curators, and perhaps also writers, to engage with Cyprus in a meaningful way. In a sense, thus, Cyprus would become a case study. Yet, and perhaps more importantly, POINT would act as a generous platform for the production of works of contemporary art.\r\n\r\nIf I were to describe POINT today, I would say it is an idea with a space. An idea first, then a space. And I mean this as a compliment to the work that Andree has put into this project, which I have had the fortune to see come to life, as the late Brazlian artist Helio Oticia would put it, “against adversity!” Especially today, in these troubled times that we are going through, and in which the financial future of entire regions seems to be evaporating, it seems to me essential to bring the activities developed in contemporary art to bear upon the challenges that each immediate environment poses, and to connect the work of art with the drama of our everyday lives.\r\n\r\n As a member of the advisory board, I was invited to organize one of the first activities of POINT after the opening of its space in the center of Nicosia. For this occasion I organized a four-day symposium with an international group of colleagues, whom I invited to speak about an issue that each of them considered urgent, both in terms of contemporary art and in terms of the current social and political world we each live in. The theme was thus quite open, and I had chosen not to predetermine the content of the conversations in order to place some of the responsibility on the group itself, rather than on each individual. In the end I think that the exercise was fruitful, albeit in ways different than I anticipated\r\nAt first my hope was that by the group would have to find a way to act collectively, and each one’s pressing concerns would have to give way to a collective one; or that from a series of individual concerns a general or collective one would emerge. Yet, one of the most immediate turns that we took as a group was to focus on the present tense, on Cyprus, and more specifically on POINT itself, and to see POINT as a work in progress, and as a project that we all stood behind and wanted to help go as far as possible.\r\n\r\nWho was the immediate audience of POINT? This was our first question. It was a complicated question too. In most cases, in most places like Nicosia where the system of contemporary art is rather precarious, the sense is that the audience is limited in numbers and in scope. Yet, POINT was in the process of passing from being an idea, to becoming a public space, a space that could be visited by the public, and in which people could gather, see art, discuss, have coffee perhaps, linger. Thus the question of the public became the originary question in our conversation, which included an architect (Andreas Angelidakis), three directors of contemporary art institusions (Andree Zivanari, Matts Stjernstedt and Anne Szefer Karlsen), two artists (Haris Epaminonda and Christodoulos Panayiotou), and myself, acting as an independent curator and as the organizer of the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe public is always an abstraction. It is an abstraction in at least two senses: In one sense, it is a group that belongs to the social sphere, the populace, but which does not necessarily represent society at large; in another sense, it is, or can be, the currency (or legal tender) of the culture industry, in which case it is usually reduced to mere numbers. In our case we were not concerned with numbers, but with the possibilities that a space such as POINT could bring to Nicosia, to Cyprus, to its inhabitants, to the people that live and work there. Perhaps our most important conclusion was that it is not only exposure to contemporary art that matters in the increasingly precarious reality of Cyprus, but the possibility of constructing something new, of engaging people in a constructive enterprise, a project that each person that passes through it as public can become its collaborator. Our discussion was thus aimed at establishing some route or routes that could make of this space a space of collective production, a space that is dedicated to contemporary art but which is also a product of the many people who pass through it, and who in one way or another can see themselves as contributing to something new, and to the creation of something that is missing, that is not there, that emerges from within the space of negation: not a museum, not a gallery, not a collection, and so on.\r\n\r\nPOINT is not a center; it is not a gallery; nor is it a museum or a collecting institution: by framing it through this series of negations, I am articulating, I hope, its aim to remove itself from the functionalist and instrumentalist uses of culture, and emphasizing its search for the most immaterial value for contemporary art and culture. In other words, I am hoping to emphasize that POINT is an experiment in factoring out the burden of the commercial transaction in the exploration of reality through art.\r\n\r\nJuan A.

The exhibition brings together existing and newly commissioned work under the title *Stories from the Lives of My Friends*.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, the celebrated Russian dramaturge Anton Chekhov wrote in a letter to his intimate friend Aleksey Suvorin: [‘Guess what! I’m writing a novel!! […] And what an intricate plot! I’ve called it *Stories from the Lives of My Friends*.’](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/letter-chekhov) This was a novel that Chekhov would never complete. By borrowing the allusive title of this unfulfilled project, Panayiotou does not attempt a retrospective speculation on this lost literary impulse; on the contrary, he proposes the title as a radical interpretation of Chekhov’s dramaturgy and relevant notion of subtext. As Stanislavski wrote, ‘Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches, but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word […] the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak.’ The concept of [subtext](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/subtext), especially after its elevation to a method in the United States and its global propagation, remains an important link between modern and contemporary theatre.\r\n\r\nTheatrical legacies, aspects and notions such as ‘subtext’, ‘estrangement effect’ and ‘disillusionment’, are pivotal elements in Panayiotou’s practice. For his exhibition at Point he puts together a series of works which, like Chekov\'s characters, develop beyond what is enounced. Associations and intimate dialogues are implied rather than exposed and elaborate dialectics are staged, thus facilitating – almost provocatively – the emergence of new discourses. Panayiotou’s choice of materials puts the idea of a dominant truth into question and challenges the ways we perceive and interpret our collective and individual narratives.\r\n',NULL),(75,1,'2016-03-02 10:54:22','2017-06-03 17:26:48',5,'STORIES FROM THE LIVES OF OUR FRIENDS: WORKS DOWNSTAIRS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\n<br />*The Sea*, 2012, ceramic tiles, each 35 x 35 cm\r\n\r\nThe ceramic door titled *The Sea* occupies the main exhibition area of Point’s ground floor. The handmade terracotta tiles were produced in Limassol, using salt water from the Mediterranean Sea rather than pumped water as is usually the case. The first variation of this piece was presented at dOCUMENTA 13, (which, together with the dilapidated electricity poles from Limassol’s Independence Street, alluded to the historical events Panayiotou has sourced from the diary of Bruno Cannoni, the technician who undertook the electrification of Limassol in 1931–32). Another version of the work was shown more recently at Panayiotou’s solo show at Moderna Musset, *Ages and Days* (where the installation referred to the activities of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition and the shipment of the archaeological findings of the Swedish Expedition). For his exhibition at Point, Panayiotou has chosen to install the work in radical relation to the adjacent street. All the doors of the Art Centre will be kept wide open during the opening hours, allowing for the ceramic door to function as a square and therefore question the strict distinction between the inside and outside, the private and the public.\r\n\r\n<br />*The Price of Copper*, 2014, copper fountain, raw copper sheet, wood and metal base, dimensions variable\r\n\r\n*The Price of Copper* is a fountain created from a single sheet of unworked copper sourced from the Skouriotissa Copper Mine in the Xeros area of Cyprus. Copper mining is a dominant subject in the archaeological and historiographical discourse of Cyprus. Skouriotissa is said to be the oldest operating mine in the world and central to the flux of Cypriot history (from antiquity to the days of the labour struggles of the 20th century). Beyond the specific context of the copper in question, Panayiotou has borrowed the title of this piece from a parable proposed by Berthold Brecht in his homonymous sketch for a book *Der Messingkauf* (translated as ‘The Price of Copper’). In *Der Messingkauf*, the German dramaturge narrates the story of a client who enters a musical instruments store and expresses the desire to buy a trumpet. He proposes a price much lower than the selling price of the instrument, explaining to the seller that he is neither interested in the instrument, nor does he know how to use it; he simply wants the metal, (thus clearly demonstrating his disregard for the concept of added value). In *The Price of Copper* Panayiotou takes Brecht\'s parable as a guide that he follows in order to create a ‘sculpture’ that is an improvised fountain. The piece was made spontaneously with found materials that render it a fountain only so long as the water is running. As soon as the water stops running, the piece becomes, once again, a mere sheet of copper.\r\n\r\n<br />*Operation Serenade*, 2012, rolled-up red carpet, 50 x 50 x 123 cm\r\n\r\nCommissioned for *One Thousand and One Days* (Museum of Contemporary Art, Saint Louis, 2012) the red rolled-up carpet set on the door is a feature from a larger series of similar items. The seven carpets are retired carpets from major Hollywood awards ceremonies (i.e. the Oscars, the Emmys and the Grammys). As a symbol, the ‘red carpet’ used at these events surpasses in significance the actual event itself. Such is its associative power, the idea of the red carpet has entered contemporary western mythology and by extension the actual globalised economy. The title of the work alludes to the official code name for the funeral of American President Ronald Reagan (1911-2004; President 1980-1989), who, before becoming a politician, had been a celebrated Hollywood actor. Panayiotou’s use of the funeral\'s code name is inspired by its strangely poetic nature, as well as by the descriptions of its elaborate planning and the theatrical and the implied sense of anticipation and closure that characterised the event. \r\n\r\n‘*Operation Serenade* thus suggests the striking similarities between a ritual such as the funeral procession of an important head of state and the red carpet portion of an awards ceremony: both are publicly observed spectacles involving the movement of people from one place to another to acknowledge and ascribe a sense of finality on human achievement.  The artist’s presentation of carpets rolled up and not unfurled withholds our access to the aura of celebrity that they imply.’ \r\n\r\n(Dominic Molon, from the exhibition guide to *One Thousand and One Days*, Museum of Contemporary Art, St. Louis)',NULL),(76,1,'2016-03-02 11:27:09','2017-06-04 20:56:20',7,'ARAM MOSHAYEDI',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'aram-moshayedi',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Aram Moshayedi](https://www.instagram.com/amoshayedi/?hl=en) is the curator of the Hammer Museum, where he has organised solo presentations from the Hammer Contemporary Collection featuring works by Pentti Monkkonen and Hirsch Perlman. \r\n\r\nHe was associate curator at REDCAT from 2010 to 2013, organising exhibitions and commissioning artworks from artists like The Otolith Group, Slavs and Tatars, Jordan Wolfson, Tony Cokes, Jay Chung & Q Takeki Maeda, Ming Wong and Geoffrey Farmer. \r\n\r\nHe has also served as curator at *LA><ART* in Los Angeles.

Cyprus provides the ideal case study for this innovative exploration, extensively illustrated, of how the practice of photography in relation to its political, cultural and economic contexts both contributes and responds to the formation of identity. Contributors from Cyprus, Greece, the UK and the USA, representing diverse disciplines, draw from photography theory, art history, anthropology and sociology to explore how the island and its people have been represented photographically. They reveal how the different gazes – colonial, political, gendered, and the art photographer’s – contribute to the creation of individual and national identities and, by extension, to the creation and re-creation of imagery of Cyprus as a place. While Photography and Cyprus focuses on one geographical and cultural territory, the questions this book asks and the themes and arguments it follows apply also to other places characterised by their colonial heritage.\r\n\r\nThe intriguing example of Cyprus thus serves as a fitting test-ground for current debates relating to photography, place and identity.\r\n\r\n<br />Contents:\r\n\r\n‘Introduction’ by Nicos Philippou, Theopisti Stylianou-Lambert and Liz Wells\r\n\r\n• The Colonial Gaze: Colonial Views, Postcolonial Theories:\r\n\r\n‘John Thomson: Through Cyprus with a Camera, Between Beautiful and Bountiful Nature’ by Hercules Papaioannou\r\n\r\n‘The National Geographic and Half Oriental Cyprus’ by Nicos Philippou\r\n\r\n• The Political Gaze: Memory, Politics and the Construction of National Identities:\r\n\r\n‘Imagining Cyprus: Photographic Exhibitions on Cyprus and their Reception in Greece, 1950s–1980s’ by Iro Katsaridou\r\n\r\n‘Pride and Prejudice: Photography and Memory in Cyprus’ by Yiannis Toumazis\r\n\r\n‘Developing Identity: An Autoethnography of the Turkish Cypriot Photographic Subject’ by Alev Adil\r\n\r\n• The Gendered Gaze: Framing Gender and Other Constructions:\r\n\r\n‘En-gendering Cypriots: From Colonial Landscapes to Postcolonial Identities’ by Stavros Stavrou Karayanni\r\n\r\n‘En-gendering a Landscape: The Construction, Promotion and Consumption of the Rock of Aphrodite’ by Theopisti Stylianou-Lambert\r\n\r\n‘The Photographic Pietà: A Model of Gender, Protest and Spatial-Temporal Dislocation in Modern Cyprus’ by Elizabeth Hoak-Doering\r\n\r\n• The Art Gaze: Contemporary Art Photography:\r\n\r\n‘Tracey Emin’s Photographs and Films of Turkey and Cyprus’ by Jennifer Way\r\n\r\n‘The Art of the Buffer Zone’ by Haris Pellapaisiotis\r\n\r\n‘The Archive as a Space for Negotiating Identities: Defying “Cypriotness” in the Work of Haris Epaminonda and Christodoulos Panayioto’ by Elena Stylianou\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />Author information:\r\n\r\n[Liz Wells](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/liz-wells) is a distinguished writer, researcher, teacher and curator in photography.

Approaching art education as a social process, this programme explores how we learn the things we learn, how art education can form our understanding of the world and how we learn through art. Working to create a socially engaged art-educational model using contemporary developments in arts education and education through art, it experiments with art educational methods and investigates the possibilities for building relationships between cultural institutions and schools.\r\n\r\nThe programme’s point of departure is contemporary discourse around the way the arts can address diversity, integration, social inclusion, and multicultural or inter-cultural education. Through this process the project reflects on current developments and debates around educational reforms. It specifically addresses the way in which cultural institutions may work with their neighbouring schools as part of their agenda for social responsibility and community engagement. It has been set up as a pilot programme that aims to research and establish a set of best practices for such collaborations. Because of [the specific character of the case of Nicosia](http://www.nicosiaproject.eu) and the area in question, the project focuses on questions of anti-discrimination and multiculturalism in formal state primary education in Cyprus. It also raises concerns about inner-city development, gentrification and the role of art in engaging with issues of social segregation. Central to the project’s mission is to advocate inclusive learning environments within the current reality of multicultural schooling.\r\n\r\nThe programme takes the form of an art educational programme specifically tailored to the students attending Eleneio and a series of events that present its results and strives to involve and address the needs of its community: \r\n\r\n(1) Design and execution of an educational programme, [a series of workshops](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/workshops) tailored to the needs of the local community, and more specifically, to those of Eleneio Elementary School \r\n\r\n(2) Exhibition and community events promoting Eleneio, the programme and multicultural education\r\n\r\n(3) The organisation of a symposium, sharing best practices and expertise between professionals and practitioners in arts education and multicultural education fields \r\n\r\n(4) The production of an informational package on best arts education practices for the local community to be disseminated online	\r\n \r\n',NULL),(83,1,'2016-03-22 15:18:46','2017-06-07 19:22:12',156,'FRAGMENTS: AN OPEN CALL',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'open-call',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nThis is an open call for submissions related to practices of art education in Cyprus.

When the call for papers came through, the themes chosen by conference organisers Evanthia Tselika and Chrystalleni Loizidou sparked my attention because of their focus on the imperative for gallery and museums to meaningfully address the needs of communities. This presented an opportunity to discuss the importance of institutional practices in defining constructive citizenship models. The defining questions in the call for papers took a social and cultural approach to gallery education and had an edginess not usually seen in a UK context. This was interesting to me as an artist, gallery educator and lecturer. The conference also provided a great opportunity to visit Cyprus, to discuss local patterns of segregation and the role that pedagogy can play in such a divided country. I had been keen to visit Nicosia following the unrealised Manifesta 6 in Nicosia in 2006 and the discussions that emerged from *Notes for an Art School* (2010) about the conflict that exists within creative education between the individual and the society.\r\n\r\nOur thinking was framed by a welcoming address by conference organisers Chrystalleni and Evanthia in which they situated the conference within the broader narrative of their work with diverse cultural groups in Nicosia and the limitations of inclusive pedagogies. The debates got off to a flying start with papers that addressed online education in museums through the study of Getty Games and museum-based pedagogic tools. The questions and comments that followed quickly dealt with issues surrounding gaming strategies and education versus entertainment, and asked what the point of engaging young people in the arts was. Often conferences maintain a ‘them and us’ relation between audience and speakers, but this was not the case here as there were plenty of people wanting to engage in lively discussion from the start. The moderator’s open attitude to the format of response by the audience meant that the presenters offered provocations and the audience created the discussion. With the usual hierarchies already disturbed, I knew we were off to a good start.\r\n\r\nAfter a break, the second session explored social responsibility with a punchy critique of incentives for museum education and a fascinating study of visitor photography in museums. More thoughtful exchanges followed about the pros and cons of taking photographs of artworks—that ownership is capital and putting a picture on Instagram creates cultural, social and symbolic capital. This made me think about the impact of ownership on engaging with the arts and the ways in which a selfie taken on a smart phone can provide visitors with a meaningful take-away through which they can share an experience, knowledge and art work with their friends and add it to their memory bank to potentially recall and use again when encountering other cultural artefacts in the future.\r\n\r\nA splendid lunch preceded a session in which the links between the classroom and the museum were explored from Greek, Serbian and Cypriot perspectives. For the fourth session delegates chose to either attend a gallery workshop about thinking through art with local audiences or to engage in speaker presentations reflecting on Cypriot projects that ranged from the education work of the A.G. Leventis gallery, Fouskopolis (an inflatable space for artistic experience within the city), and a fascinating Nicosia-based project called ‘Confrontation Through Art’ in which art is used as a mechanism for addressing division, conflict and confrontation. Day one drew to a close with an interactive keynote address from Dr Viv Golding in which feminist-hermeneutic strategies were explored as a means to understanding prejudice and stereotypes. The combination of practical strategies and images of carefully selected art works was both stimulating and rewarding after such a thought-provoking day.\r\n\r\nDay two began with a reflection on current practices in Sweden and Greece that explored theatre and cinema to work through social issues, while next-door a workshop explored gender in the Cyprus Archaeological Museum. A keynote presentation by Jessica Gogan from Instituto MESA provided a glimpse into the Brazilian context for museum education from the Freirian viewpoint of exploring the world before the word, positing an approach in which the context should be acknowledged and understood before the conversation happens.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sessions included presentations that explored multiliteracies for inclusive museum education programmes, notions of contemporaneity and identity formation in international modern art, and a survey of educational practices in Bulgarian museums. The final sessions explored the learning environments created by art museums and the pedagogic possibilities for equality awareness practices.\r\n\r\nClosing remarks and farewells demonstrated an atmosphere of kinship amongst peers in which a prevailing sense of forward action was acknowledged to be necessary to repair the inadequacies of current political and institutional agendas that aim for inclusion and achieve nothing but greater income for the institution. It was agreed that more needs to be done as such agendas do not benefit local communities but ease the social guilt of wealthy nations, individuals and organisations. Many contacts were made and hopefully many worthwhile projects will follow.',NULL),(92,1,'2016-03-28 14:58:35','2017-06-07 21:23:21',187,'ESTHER SAYERS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'esther-sayers',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Esther Sayers](http://www.gold.ac.uk/educational-studies/staff/sayers/) holds a BA in 3D Design from Brighton University, UK, an MA in Fine Art from Staffordshire University, UK, and a PhD in Education from Goldsmiths University, UK.\r\n\r\nEsther worked at [Tate Modern](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jade.12065/abstract;jsessionid=9491106730E0EDAB27BFF067C82212B7.f04t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) (1999–2011) as an Artist Educator and as Curator for School and Youth Programmes; as a gallery educator at Tate Liverpool and Whitechapel Gallery; a lecturer at Loughborough and Staffordshire Universities, and Special Projects Coordinator at Camden Arts Centre.

This is followed by a comparison of the protagonists.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the focus is on the comparison of the cosmogonic tone of the works, which is closely related to the recurrent serpent and lion imagery. The analysis is based on close reading, contextual information and secondary readings.

Gaitan\r\n\r\nAlmost two years ago, Andre Zivanari and I met and discussed her idea of opening a space in Nicosia, in Cyprus, dedicated to international contemporary art and its discourse. In spite of knowing little about Cyprus, I understood immediately that such an initiative was essential. In our conversations I could see that Andre’s motivation was to intensify the level of artistic activity in Cyprus, and provide a platform where an already stimulating local scene could benefit from encounters with international crowds. At the same time, Andre’s intention, it seemed to me, was to use Point as a space in which the near and the distant would enter into a dialogue, especially through invitations to artists, curators, and perhaps also writers, to engage with Cyprus in a meaningful way. Thus, in a sense, Cyprus would become a case study. Yet, and perhaps more importantly, Point would act as a generous platform for the production of works of contemporary art.\r\n\r\nIf I were to describe Point today, I would say it is an idea with a space. An idea first, then a space. And I mean this as a compliment to the work that Andre has put into this project, which I have had the fortune to see come to life, as the late Brazlian artist Helio Oticia would put it, \'against adversity!\'. Especially today, in these troubled times that we are going through, and in which the financial future of entire regions seems to be evaporating, it seems to me essential to bring the activities developed in contemporary art to bear upon the challenges that each immediate environment poses, and to connect the work of art with the drama of our everyday lives.\r\nAs a member of the advisory board, I was invited to organise one of the first activities of Point after the opening of its space in the centre of Nicosia. For this occasion I organised a four-day symposium with an international group of colleagues, whom I invited to speak about an issue that they each considered urgent, both in terms of contemporary art and in terms of the current social and political world we each live in. The theme was thus quite open, and I had chosen not to predetermine the content of the conversations in order to place some of the responsibility on the group itself, rather than on each individual. In the end I think that the exercise was fruitful, albeit in ways different from what I had anticipated. At first, my hope was that the group would have to find a way to act collectively, and each one’s pressing concerns would have to give way to a collective one; or that from a series of individual concerns a general or collective one would emerge. Yet, one of the most immediate turns that we took as a group was to focus on the present tense, on Cyprus, and more specifically on Point itself, and to see Point as a work in progress, and as a project that we all stood behind and wanted to help go as far as possible.\r\n\r\nWho was the immediate audience of Point? This was our first question. It was a complicated question too. In most cases, in most places like Nicosia where the system of contemporary art is rather precarious, the sense is that the audience is limited in numbers and in scope. Yet, Point was in the process of passing from being an idea to becoming a public space, a space that could be visited by the public, and in which people could gather, see art, discuss, have coffee, perhaps linger. Thus the question of the public became the original question in our conversation, which included an architect (Andreas Angelidakis), three directors of contemporary art institutions (Andre Zivanari, Mats Stjernstedt and Anne Szefer Karlsen), an artist (Christodoulos Panayiotou), and myself, acting as an independent curator and as the organiser of the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe public is always an abstraction. It is an abstraction in at least two senses. In one sense, it is a group that belongs to the social sphere, the populace, but which does not necessarily represent society at large. In another sense, it is, or can be, the currency (or legal tender) of the culture industry, in which case it is usually reduced to mere numbers. In our case, we were not concerned with numbers, but with the possibilities that a space such as Point could bring to Nicosia, to Cyprus, to its inhabitants,  and to the people that live and work there. Perhaps our most important conclusion was that it is not only exposure to contemporary art that matters in the increasingly precarious reality of Cyprus, but the possibility of constructing something new, of engaging people in a constructive enterprise, a project that allows each person who passes through it as ‘the public’ to become a collaborator. Our discussion was thus aimed at establishing some route or routes that could make Point a space of collective production, a space that is dedicated to contemporary art but which is also a product of the many people who pass through it, and who in one way or another can see themselves as contributing to something new and to the creation of something that is missing, that is not there yet but that will emerge from within the space of negation: not a museum, not a gallery, not a collection, and so on.\r\n\r\nPoint is not a centre; it is not a gallery; nor is it a museum or a collecting institution: by framing it through this series of negations, I am articulating, I hope, its aim to remove itself from the functionalist and instrumentalist uses of culture, and emphasising its search for the most immaterial value for contemporary art and culture. In other words, I am hoping to emphasise that Point is an experiment in factoring out the burden of the commercial transaction in the exploration of reality through art.\r\n',NULL),(106,1,'2016-03-29 11:33:07','2017-06-07 22:05:06',225,'IMAGES AND VIEWS OF ALTERNATIVE CINEMA 2015',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'cyprus-alternative-cinema-festival',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\n18 – 24.06.2015\r\n\r\nPress Release:\r\n\r\n*Images and Views of Alternative Cinema* opens its doors for the 12th year, showcasing international avant-garde and experimental films.

Their captivating passages brim with wit, wry observation and (occasional) disgust, offering viewers ‘ways out’, even if only while reading.\r\n\r\nCommissioned by [If I Can’t Dance, I Don’t Want to Be Part of Your Revolution](http://www.ificantdance.org/Editions/EditionV/GerryBibby), *The Drumhead* follows a two-year collaboration with KUB Arena of the Kunsthaus Bregenz; [The Showroom](http://howtoworktogether.org/commissions/gerry-bibby/), London; CCA, Glasgow, and the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane. The book immodestly distils these institutional encounters into a multipart narrative that delves into the lives and psyches of those in the service industry. Exhaustion and frustration besiege a set of characters and the architecture that barely contains them, all of which are cipher-like in their multiplicity (and duplicity).',NULL),(115,1,'2016-03-30 08:16:22','2017-06-07 22:55:09',285,'YES NO FUTURE',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'yes-no-future',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br/>\r\nA reading by Gerry Bibby\r\n\r\n27.11 – 3.12.2015, 21:00\r\n\r\n<br/>Excerpt from a [text](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/018-something-queer) by Gerry Bibby published in *Starship 14, A Plastic Island of the Mind*, Berlin, Spring 2016\r\n\r\n\'[…] I made a show while there at the place that hosted me called Point. Sounds sharp, but just as I’d been reassured back in London, they were very generous. The gallery was in a part of the city that used to be fancy not so long ago but whose streets now featured rows of empty glass facades after said financial collapse. The gallery’s windows face a street whose dead end just tens of meters away drops into the moat of the Old City, where a Zaha Hadid metal skeleton scandal was in the process of becoming a concrete ambassadorial public anomaly for a new city, a projection of a unified city?\r\n \r\n\'Three sculptures in the show *Yes No Future* toyed with the letters O X & I … strung together in that line from left to right, they translate as NO in English. The word it spells has a longer history than the recent referendum in that other Greek-speaking part of the world that voted for a rejection of Euro Zone fiscal imperatives: it turns out there is a 70-odd-year-old commemoration day named after the word, also celebrated in Cyprus. Each letter is spelt out with those ribbed metal bars normally used as armature in concrete building construction. It’s the same material Hadid’s almost monument was gobbling up. These bars appear bare all over the island in the guise of hair-like protrusions, sprouting from the tops of mostly domestic buildings. There they allow for further floors to be built, upwardly speculating familial expansion. In this form they’re called αναμονές in Greek, which translates as something like ‘anticipations’. The O of NO as sculpture is subtitled ‘Reclining – or Sleeping—Soldier’. A worn used plinth from the gallery lay prostrate on the floor, the bars drilling their way through the top; now one side of the plinth to trace the line of O in pointed protrusions, it looks something like a round of bullets, sleeping. […]\r\n\r\n\'There was a fourth sculpture at Point, *J for Ja*, and when I paste in Glissant here, I want to write one last shoutout to those people I met in Nicosia … I want to write geniuses, but I’m back in the Germany re-united where a million migrants have been allowed right of stay.

In the theatre he is highly regarded for his only four plays and his work with the Moscow Art Theatre (MXAT), specifically his collaboration with director Konstantin Stanislavski.\r\n\r\nHis writing began out of necessity to provide for himself and his family in Moscow where his father had fled to avoid debtors’ prison. In order to provide for the family as well as pay his tuition to medical school, he began to submit daily humorous, short stories to publishers. Although his fame comes from his writing, he always considered his work as a physician his primary career.\r\n\r\nIronically (for a physician), Chekhov found himself wrestling constantly with tuberculosis from 1884 onwards. He was not officially diagnosed until 1897, when he suffered a haemorrhage in his lungs that resulted in a necessary change in lifestyle, prompting his move to the countryside town of Yalta.\r\n\r\nAnton’s brother Ivan worked as a school teacher and tutor in Voskressensk, outside  Moscow. Each year the Chekhov family would spend their summer in the village with Ivan. A military battery, led by the Colonel B.I. Mayevsky was also stationed in Voskressensk at the time. Anton became close friends with the Colonel and his family, and it was from his time in the small town that he gained the military and rural-life inspiration for Three Sisters.\r\n\r\nAs his popularity as a playwright grew, he would split his time between his home in Yalta and Moscow where he could attend rehearsals at the Moscow Art Theatre. He died in 1908, finally succumbing to tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nSource: [Three Sisters Program Notes](http://www.uh.edu/cota/theatre-and-dance/buy-tickets/2015-2016/threeSisters/_doc/Three%20Sisters%20Program%20Notes.pdf)',NULL),(152,1,'2016-03-31 17:33:48','2017-05-25 16:08:48',65,'BIDOUN LIBRARY AT POINT',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'bidoun-library',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nCurated by [Babak Radboy](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/babak-radboy)\r\n\r\n15.12.2012 – 15.02.2013\r\n\r\nPress Release:\r\n\r\n‘For those who don’t know the Middle East, it may be well to mention that this is not a work of satire.’\r\n\r\n– F.

And, considering that collage feeds largely on images of ‘generic’ sources – I mean that it sucks its lymph [sic] not only and not primarily from art – where else does your inspiration come from? \r\n\r\nHaris Epaminonda: Usually, I have no idea what I will come up with. I choose the image and let it guide me. It all happens intuitively. Like a chain reaction, everything influences everything and in effect all things are interrelated with each other. If I were to use a sentence to describe what I wish one day to achieve, it would be Lao Tzu’s saying: ‘Take everything that happens as it comes. As something to animate, not to appropriate.’\r\n\r\nCT: Now you stun me with Taoism? I’m not a Taoist but I find its teachings very beautiful and in tune with the natural order of things. What else do you find beautiful? \r\n\r\nHE: The face of my mother, the smile of my father, Maria’s harmonious profile and Annita’s thick black eyelashes. I’m a huge fan of plants also. We always had flowers and plants in our house. My father’s business was to do with flower shops. I think my dog is beautiful also. \r\n\r\nCT: When I listen to you, it is as though you don’t give much importance to the idea of art as a career, and you don’t seem to be obsessed by this reality/circle. Nor are you overly emphatic when explaining the starting point of your work. Am I wrong? What can you tell me about it? \r\n\r\nHE: I don’t really like forcing things. If something is meant to happen, it will happen. If not, perhaps there was a reason for it. I don’t mean being passive. I’m just focused on what I do and I see where that takes me. I think the struggle to always reinvent oneself time and again is in itself hard work. For me there is only one way. Everything is in transition. Who knows how life develops. \r\n\r\nCT: And how would you describe your work if you had to? \r\n\r\nHE: I’m not so good at describing my own work. I think it’s very open and dreamy and somehow escapes affirmation, but then again I don’t really know.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nArtists at Work: Haris Epaminonda and Sonia Campagnola, *Afterall*, 7 October 2008:\r\n\r\nSonia Campagnola: You studied in London, but you grew up in Cyprus. How do you feel now when you go back to Cyprus? Does your work have roots there? \r\n\r\nHaris Epaminonda: I like its dryness ... I feel a strong connection to the memories of my home and my family. The years I lived in Cyprus have influenced my way of seeing things, but I can’t say its a source for my work itself. It’s more my thinking of home. Something I miss is my language. Sometimes I get frustrated, so I write. I always keep a diary with me, with what I do and my thoughts, especially when I travel.\r\n\r\nSC: You live in Berlin now, and you’re taking part in this year’s Berlin Biennial with your installation Untitled (2008) at the Neue Nationalgalerie. What’s the story behind it? \r\n\r\nHE: In the beginning I wanted to show a new series of collages together with the project [The Infinite Library](http://www.theinfinitelibrary.com) that I am working on with German artist [Daniel Gustav Cramer](http://www.danielgustavcramer.com). We work mainly by focusing on books from the 1920s to the 1970s. We love the way the ink sits on the paper, and look for images that have an abstract quality. One can sense the time that is lost. We use mainly picture books, putting one part of a book on another. \r\n\r\nSC: Let’s take *Tarahi VI*. How did you realise it? Where did you source the images and how did you choose the music?  \r\n\r\nHE: The images were taken from Greek films of the 1960s. I chose the ones that I felt closest to. I never know what I will come up with, but I generally have a strong feeling of how to work with images and sound. It’s all about rhythm and the way things come together. Robert Bresson says: ‘... you take two images, they are neutral, but all of a sudden, next to each other, they vibrate, life enters them ...’. This is what I feel with moving images. It’s what you do with them and the order they appear in that can trigger a movement, not just motion but also emotion. Of course sound plays a big role as well. In this case, one piece runs through *Tarahi IIII, V, VI – Alexander Scriabins Tenth Sonata* (1913). \r\n\r\nSC: Bresson\'s work is a point of reference in your work. Who else do you find important to observe? \r\n\r\nHE: Photographer [Luigi Ghirr](http://www.frieze.com/article/all-other-images) and [Bresson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVODh2lkVdc) are the two names I can think of right now. Both of them have left deep impression on me.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nUnresolved and Unanswered and Unspoken: Jacob Fabricius in Conversation with Haris Epaminonda, *Fillip*, No. 11 (2010):\r\n\r\nJacob Fabricius: One of the first things you did when you arrived in Malmö was to buy second-hand books. Can you briefly explain what kind of books you were looking for and how you would use them in the process of working? \r\n\r\nHaris Epaminonda: I’m interested in books made during the 1930s up to the 1960s as I very much like the painterly qualities of the images printed during that time, their colours, and the way the images appear on the paper. These images are taken from books that belong to a past time, from a scattered and fragmented image of the world. If we could say that books are testimonials of people who have written about, travelled, studied, and documented the world, unconsciously striving to make sense of it and, consequently, themselves, then perhaps I’m doing nothing more than putting bits of this puzzle together in ways that construct my own subjective image of the world. I guess such an image is, as with every image, in accordance with that which one pays attention to and, therefore, catches within one\'s own manifestation of reality. \r\n\r\nJF: In some of your films you use a moving image within a still image, and the still image becomes the frame, so to speak. Would you agree there is a very distinct sensibility for time in your work? If so, how? \r\n\r\nHE: Yes, I like to create images where time feels as if it does not exist. To think of time in relation to movement, I imagine the work living outside real time, that is, without any movement or logic except that found within the realm of fantasy. \r\n\r\nJF: You often take the full page and frame it as your work. Why is the full page important? \r\n\r\nHE: I don’t really see the pages themselves as my work. The work in most instances takes shape once it is installed in the space, as a kind of spatial assemblage of images. The images and objects, taken out of their context and juxtaposed together, have, for me, the potential to turn into detoured metaphors. \r\n\r\nJF: When we began talking about the exhibition, you sent a sketch of twenty very different plinths that you wanted to be made. Some look like normal plinths, but others look like they are taken straight out of De Chirico paintings. They become sculptures or architectural objects themselves. You mentioned that you were inspired by the Pergamon Museum. Could you talk a bit about how that is present in the show?\r\n\r\nHE: Actually, I mentioned the Pergamon Museum because I visited it not long ago and was really fascinated by it. I like museums because they are odd places, totally constructed, full of ‘things’ taken out of context, often of a ghostly nature. I remember very vividly the Egyptian museum in Cairo – quite an amazing place; the eerie room with the mummified bodies, and the vast number of pedestals and vitrines in each room. Thinking about museums and pedestals – and of the Greek word ‘mouseion’, which translates as \'the seat of the muses\', in literal terms – the pedestal would be as such a ‘seat’ on which an artefact is placed in order to be looked at. In [*The Disquieting Muses*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/haris/muse) (1916) by De Chirico there is an interesting relation between the pedestal and the object, the seat and the seated. Coming to your question about how the twenty pedestals idea developed, in fact, they grew gradually through sketches and drawings into more abstracted forms inspired by various features found in ancient archaeological sites. For example, the Sumerian Ziggurat of Ur, the Cambodian Angkor Wat site – whose pyramid-like structures have profound similarities with those of the Pre-Columbian Mayan monuments, tombs, and temples in Chichén Itzá, Monte Albán, and Guatemala – all have clear similarities with the pyramids of Egypt. I had this image in my head of placing an ostrich egg on each of the pedestals, but left as it is, with its natural colour and texture, becoming one unified form together with the geometric structure that supports it. The egg almost feels as if it could be hand-crafted from the finest porcelain into an object that only resembles the real thing, the real egg. Perhaps that is the destiny of the elevated ‘muse’, to be stripped of its meaning as the personification of inspiration and creativity and become a mere signifier of its own self-image.\r\n\r\nJF: Your works evoke a dreamlike distant world. In the 1950s and 1960s, a period from which many of your magazine images and collages come, the idea of progress and a fascination with the future appear filled with both hope and fear, and your work seems to float between a real and a potential or illusory past/future.\r\n \r\nHE: I like to think of the past as having no ‘telos’. History, as with found images, belongs to the past. Although the moment is taken out of context, it bears the promise of eternal transformation.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nKaren Wilson-Goldie: ‘Haris Epaminonda IV’, *Bidoun*, No. 20 (2010):\r\n\r\nIn the current climate of overly self-analysed artistic production, Epaminonda is rare in that she doesn’t bother building any discursive or textual scaffolding around her work (biographical or geopolitical readings are therefore totally beside the point). For her contribution to the catalogue of the 2009 Sharjah Biennial, for example, she eluded the editors’ request to respond to a survey (‘Could you tell us about the work you’re showing in the biennial?’ and ‘What challenges have you faced so far?’) by submitting an excerpt from Maurice Blanchot’s *Friendship* instead. Not an excerpt, exactly, but a photocopied spread of the first two pages of the book’s 14th chapter, entitled Destroy. Enigmatic outside its intended context (‘Let us say it calmly: one must love in order to destroy’), the section ends, mid-sentence, on the word ‘without’.\r\n\r\nSubstituting a selection from Blanchot’s text in place of her own thoughts or ideas, Epaminonda dodged the more or less explicit demand to explain herself, her work, and her practice. Rather than a description or exposition of her Sharjah commission – consisting of fifteen Polaroids and a video projecting a single still image of a zebra, colour streaked across its neck, being immobilized by three men, one of whom seemed rather shocked to have gotten two hands around the animal’s tail – the artist simply added another layer of her art, which hinges considerably on oblique associations and gestures.',NULL),(155,1,'2016-04-01 13:31:46','2016-04-01 13:31:46',NULL,'The disquieting muse/DeChirico',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-disquieting-muse%2Fdechirico',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(156,1,'2016-04-01 13:43:13','2016-04-01 13:43:13',NULL,'DeChirico/The disquieting muse',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dechirico%2Fthe-disquieting-muse',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(157,1,'2016-04-01 13:49:16','2017-03-14 15:50:53',NULL,'DESQUIETING MUSE/GEORGIO DE CHIRICO',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'muse',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'One of the most famous paintings both by De Chirico and of all metaphysical art, The Disquieting Muses was painted in the city of Ferrara, Italy, during World War I.

Her works rather suggest a flattening of the hierarchy between things, offering a place where illusion coexists with the tangible, and where each thing can be read and examined on a single plane.\r\n\r\n*Chapters* is a poetic series of meticulously staged scenes, with underlying narrative elements of love, longing, afterlife and ritual. Visitors can expect to encounter a universe of melancholy beauty in which the artist crafts timeless vignettes, using Cypriot landscapes as the protagonists. Many of the objects, sets and costumes have been donated and produced in Cyprus, others have been granted by the Cyprus Theatre Organisation. The scenes duel between light and dark, day and night, interior and exterior, the near and the far. The actors, objects, animals and spaces shift back and forth between sculptural representations and their own symbolic and metaphorical meanings. There are various references to ancient myths and poetry, Renaissance painting and Byzantine iconography. \r\n\r\nThe use of a fixed camera is reminiscent of the tableaux-vivant from avant-garde cinema. A contemporary epic, *Chapters* challenges the nature of classical filmmaking. Originally filmed in 16mm film, and later converted into digital, the work consists of four asynchronous projections (each about an hour long), resulting in a film which is four hours in length. The projections play simultaneously on a loop, with no beginning or end. There is no particular narrative structure and any linearity is deliberately undone, taking us on an associative  journey that is constantly altered and recombined by the actions of chance, time and the viewer’s gaze.\r\n\r\nThe mesmerizing soundtrack is composed by British sound-artists Kelly Jayne Jones and Pascal Nichols, also known as Part Wild Horses Mane On Both Sides. The artists parallel the methods used in the construction of the film by piecing together sounds recorded on set with samples they produced using instruments from various eras as well as using field recordings from the set.\r\n\r\nThe symbolic and formal aspects of the film have also been abstracted and extended off screen in a sparsely arranged installation of sculptural works that use the rest of the exhibition space and belong to Haris’s ongoing series *Volumes*, which began in 2009.\r\n\r\n*Chapters* is co-produced by Point Centre for Contemporary Art, together with Modern Art Oxford, Kunsthaus Zürich and the Fondazione Querini Stampalia in Venice. In each gallery Epaminonda presents the film in an entirely different way, crafting a succession of intimately connected but distinct exhibitions.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />Related Events:\r\n\r\nGuided tour by Haris Epaminonda\r\nSaturday 12 October 2013\r\nThe tour will be in Greek.

The conversation itself will culminate in a contribution to the [fifth issue of the Cyprus Dossier](https://issuu.com/cyprusdossier/docs/cyprusdossier05) on the theme of collaboration, to be launched at the 2013 Venice Biennale as part of the Cypriot-Lithuanian pavilion. An initial idea is that the conversation itself will be transcribed and part of it written up in the journal, with the names of the participants included.\r\n\r\nIssues of collectivity, authorship, participation, consensus, community behaviour, group activity, labour organization and team work are only some of the elements that are used to describe the functions of contemporary, collaborative, project-driven practices. Within such  a framework, working well with other people becomes an important asset. Likewise, breaking through the limitations of the self can assist in strengthening the process, production and development of a project or a concept. This conversation aims to critically reflect on issues of collaboration through open exchange and dialogue while addressing the concerns and ideas of the participants.\r\n\r\nWe would like to propose the following starting points:\r\n\r\nCan we identify present trends within the arts in contrast to the auteur model and can we try out models developed and tested in other fields? If different places can be said to reflect their own forms of collaborative patterns within the arts, then what has been the prevailing pattern in Cyprus?\r\n\r\nHow can local interpretations of what artistic collaboration is highlight, demonstrate and challenge a trend that has prevailed in the art world since the beginning of the 20th century and that exploded as a methodology in the 1960s?\r\n\r\nHow do different forms of collaboration act in creating community and how do they in turn challenge dominant political and social narratives and patterns?  Where does collaboration fit in within the context of ‘the social function’ of the arts (an important question in the last twenty years)?\r\n\r\nCan we speak of an ethics of collaboration beyond managerial prescriptions of good practice and models of team structure? Can we work towards developing a culture of openness in the arts that reflects on broader questions about productivity, social organisation and good governance?\r\n\r\nHow can collaboration challenge notions of nationalism?\r\n\r\nHave new technologies and social media changed the nature of collaboration?\r\n\r\nWhat is the role of open conversation and dialogue within collaborative practices?\r\n\r\nHow far can a participatory, collaborative event such as this go towards reflexively dealing with its own subject matter?',NULL),(172,1,'2016-04-04 10:10:36','2017-05-26 20:17:18',240,'ANDREA BRUNO',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'andrea-bruno',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\nAndrea Bruno (b. 1931, Italy) graduated from Turin Polytechnic University with a degree in Architecture in 1956.\r\n\r\nHe teaches architectural restoration in the schools of architecture at Milan and Turin Polytechnic Universities.

To investigate the very concept and uses of the traditional archive, Point invited 27 experts to choose an artwork from the State Collection. The chosen artworks were displayed at Point as a non-curated group exhibition and used as springboards for presentations, discussions and creative happenings.\r\n\r\n*Displays* was a participatory project about research and archival access that delved into the [archives](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/archive) of the Cyprus State Gallery of Contemporary Art. The project\'s main objective was to encourage access, new research and creative engagement with the Cypriot State Collection of Contemporary Art and its archive. To do that, it displaced works from the collection, either from exhibition or storage, and brought them to Point. In so doing, it raised new questions about, and proposed new textual and event-based revisions of, Cypriot art and the ways in which it is contextualised and historicised. \r\n\r\nFurther research into the gallery\'s archives produced a [map](http://point-centre.tumblr.com/) that traces the works of art hanging in public institutions in Cyprus, including the Presidential Palace, Parliament, the Supreme Court, the Ministry of the Exterior, and the Ministry of Education and Culture. A four-volume [catalogue](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2013/displays-book) documenting all the works in the State Gallery’s collection was produced by Point.

The presentation will focus on the spectrum of book arts (books that are made or conceived by artists and that are works of art by themselves). Contemporary artists’ books are noteworthy for their many different forms, and perhaps because of this they have an equally large number of precursors and influences. The presentation will be in Greek.\r\n\r\n*Starting point: How does a dance artist respond creatively to a visual artwork?* by Natalie Heller, a response to Andros Kazamias’ painting *Drawing*. This live performance piece won\'t be a response to the physical movement of Kazamias’ painted dancer but an interpretation of the artist’s intent. Reflected in the live moving body is a sense of internal conflict and duality. Heller invites the spectator to consider a dance work as a piece of live visual art.\r\n\r\nWatch the [live performance](https://vimeo.com/167813880).

The first part of the project is an open, collaborative, research-focused exploration of the Gallery, its library and its archives.

The information will be used to set-up interviews, to document the development of the Gallery and of the Cypriot arts, and invite dialogue around art history, archival issues, questions of arts policy and management, with the intention of giving rise to new scholarly and creative projects. \r\n\r\nThe process will give the project participants the chance to get acquainted with the Gallery and its material.

When asked what he is doing (by those around him whose personal interests prevent them from openly calling him mad), he replies that ‘if one could find the perfect arrangement of all objects in any particular space it could create a resonance’, of which ‘the benefits to the individual dwelling in that space could be extensive, far reaching’. According to Horne, there is something magical about specific assemblages of objects in space, which can produce certain effects.\r\n \r\nThe interrogation of the particular assemblage of works of art that is attempted by the *Displays* Project is bound to stumble into and face a series of questions, some of which are to be addressed by this text. There is a sense in which the questions are an effect caused by this particular assemblage of objects in space (though not exactly with Horne’s hypothetical benefits of a perfect gathering). Once things are put together in space in a particular way, then some of these questions arise.\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions relates directly to this quasi-magical effect of gathering: What is a collection? At least in name, what we are faced with here is thought to be a collection. It is not only private individuals, but also states that engage in this activity of selectively gathering objects. To talk of ‘a collector’, or private gatherer, and of the accompanying psycho-pathologies, is problematic. The boundary that separates the collector from the hoarder or the connoisseur is delicate enough when these are somehow characteristics of individuals. Is there connoisseurship involved in what here goes by the name of a ‘collection’, supposedly undertaken on behalf of more than just a private gatherer? And what about hoarding? There is, one suspects, a multiplication of derangements when we move from the problematic case of the individual collector to that of a state collection.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if it is already difficult enough to answer *why collect?* for an individual collector, then it is almost impossible even to pose such a question for those who collect in the name of others. *In the name of whom?* is another question we might ask. Are there particular ways in which collecting addresses such questions? Should there be? If so, can they be identified through an interrogation of that which is collected itself?\r\n\r\nThis question leads us to some more basic problems. I can’t touch on the question of the accessibility of the collection itself here. It’s enough to say that it is in the name of others that things are collected.\r\n\r\nThe question of authorship lingers close by. Is there a way of uncontroversially establishing that the works collected are what they are? It seems like one of the magic functions peculiar to this particular assemblage of objects in space (i.e. the state collection of the Republic of Cyprus) is that it causes the objects involved to lose the potential to be accurately identified. Some of the works seem to have done this themselves prior to being delegated to the space of oblivion that their collection implies.[1] But this collection appears, in a quasi-Benjaminian manner, radical in attempting to destabilise the notion that an artwork’s originality matters.[2] It threatens to turn future historians of art in Cyprus into archaeologists faced with an alien culture.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that very little dialogue, and much less critical inquiry, revolves around the space that is forged by this assemblage. Should this be just a matter of complaint? Such complaints might come from instrumental concerns regarding the immediate devaluation of cultural capital, another magical effect of its entrance into the space of oblivion. Should this remain a matter of a small complaint that gets superficially addressed, only to say that there has been a response to it, only to be forgotten?\r\n\r\nNo. By relocating the works in order to display them, by re-collecting them from their delegated space (of oblivion), by writing about them, some of these questions come to the fore and begin to be addressed.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n1. Kashiallos, for example, as a visitor to the National Gallery might notice upon entrance, seems to have made up ‘ancient’ Cypriot artefacts. But do we know that Kashiallos made these himself? There doesn’t seem to be adequate proof of authenticity for many of the works in the collection.\r\n\r\n2. The underlying cause for this might, nonetheless, be completely un-Benjaminian, in that the relevant information seems to presume a kind of verbal tradition. Rather than an attempted enactment of the ‘death of the author’ (which, in a radical manner, it is unavoidably heading towards), here one might diagnose a scheme based on the contingent imagined availability of a living author, who is always supposedly willing to testify to his work.',NULL),(210,1,'2016-04-07 12:58:30','2017-04-19 06:13:56',190,'HARIS EPAMINONDA',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'haris-e',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Haris Epaminonda](http://www.harisepaminonda.com/) (b. 1980, Cyprus) was educated at the Royal College of Art, Kingston University, and Chelsea College of Art & Design.

These are the questions that concern us here. We have chosen to focus primarily on sustainability. All excellent things happen through trial and error and express a set of values. My values are as follows: respect for the ingredients and the process of cooking them (this means having fewer ingredients in the beginning and gradually building on them as we build the relationships with the growers, producers and suppliers). I also believe in allowing the time to experiment as we get to know our ingredients and our tools (oven, location, staff). Respect for the community surrounding us – the art centre, the environment, our country – and not trying to be everything for everyone is equally important. This is why our menu is not a piece of paper but a booklet explaining the story behind each item on the menu, detailing the use of the ingredients and their origins, including health tips and historical backgrounds. Our menu is always in development as we try to stay seasonal and continue experimenting while we try to cater for all dietary requirements. Organic when we can, seasonal almost always, everything we prepare is prepared fresh using the best local ingredients available. Ask questions, and keep coming back for new things.\r\n',NULL),(212,1,'2016-04-07 13:33:00','2017-05-26 16:34:02',210,'CHAPTERS: PRODUCTION CREDITS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'behind-the-scenes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nDirector, cinematography, scenography/costume & set design/editor:<br />\r\nHaris Epaminonda\r\n\r\nSound:<br />\r\nKelly-Jayne Jones & Pascal Nichols\r\n<br />(Part Wild Horses Mane On Both Sides)\r\n\r\nDirector of Photography:<br />\r\nGeorge Rachmatoulin\r\n\r\nCamera assistant:<br />\r\nStephan Metzner\r\n\r\nSecond camera assistant:<br />\r\nNenad Todorovich\r\n\r\nExecutive producer:<br />\r\nAndre Zivanari\r\n\r\nProduction manager/casting:<br />\r\nSossee Eskidjian\r\n\r\nProduction assistant:<br />\r\nMelissa Hadjikyriakou\r\n\r\nElectrician:<br />\r\nCostas Georgiou\r\n\r\nSecond electrician:<br />\r\nCharis Trakoshis\r\n\r\nMake-up:<br />\r\nGloria Nicolaou\r\n\r\nRunner:<br />\r\nRobert Carcamo, Mel\r\n\r\nTraditional flute recording:<br />\r\nAndreas Kristakkos\r\n\r\nCatering:<br />\r\nPHC Franchised Restaurants Ltd, Iris Michaelidou\r\n\r\nDriver:<br />\r\nGeorge Smilkov\r\n\r\nTailors:<br />\r\nLagorzeta Factory, Veronica\r\n\r\nCamera:<br />\r\n16mm Arri SR3\r\n\r\nFilm:<br />\r\nKodak\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nCast:<br />\r\nChristina Constantinou<br />\r\nMarios Ioannou<br />\r\nAndreas Koutsoumbas<br />\r\nPanos Makris<br />\r\nDimitris Savvas<br />\r\nSanson Emade<br />\r\nJokshan Sadeesh Perera<br />\r\nWaduge Shehan Sameera Livera<br />\r\nRobert Carcamo<br />\r\nMel<br />\r\nAndreas Kristakkos<br />\r\nDionysia Mestana<br />\r\nAndreas Panayiotou<br />\r\nRen Nali<br />\r\nLu Tis<br />\r\nHerath Mudiyanselage Nayomi<br />\r\nMuthu Manike<br />\r\nSubasinghe Nayana<br />\r\nIhalawattegedara Nanda Shila<br />\r\nKoralalage Iakshmi Priyador Shni<br />\r\nNandari De Silva<br />\r\nMadhu Brahmama<br />\r\nWicramasinhe Nadeeka<br />\r\nThanuja<br />\r\nReza Khanlo<br />\r\nHasan Honarmand<br />\r\nGiorgos Papaioannou<br />\r\nLubomir Hudoyiarov<br />\r\nVitaly Mour<br />\r\nChris Prousis<br />\r\nYiannis Lesgaris<br />\r\nMarios Dimitri<br />\r\nPetros Nikolaou<br />\r\nRumen<br />\r\nThoma<br />\r\nBlagovest<br />\r\nSeverin<br />\r\nRambo\r\n\r\n(No animals were harmed in the making of this film)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nCommissioners:<br />\r\nKunsthaus Zürich<br />\r\nModern Art Oxford<br />\r\nPoint Centre for Contemporary Art, Nicosia<br />\r\nFondazione Querini Stampalia, Venice<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:<br />\r\nEnea Righi & Lorenzo Paini<br />\r\nSandros Ioannou<br />\r\nGiorgos Papageorgiou<br />\r\nMichalis Spanos<br />\r\nEftychia Zachariou\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThanks to:<br />\r\nAndre Zivanari<br />\r\nDaniel Gustav Cramer<br />\r\nEleni & Ioannis Epaminonda<br />\r\nBarbara Cramer<br />\r\nMirjam Varadinis<br />\r\nEmily Korchmáros<br />\r\nAndrea Viliani<br />\r\nChiara Bertola<br />\r\nSylvia Kouvali<br />\r\nRuth Keshisian<br />\r\nMaroulla Zivanari<br />\r\nGiorgos Orfanos<br />\r\nPavlos Fotsios<br />\r\nStelios Lenas<br />\r\nSavvas Siakas<br />\r\nPierre Dechavanne<br />\r\nMaria Saranti<br />\r\nMichalis Kyriakides<br />\r\nPresviteros Asinou<br />\r\nPresviteros Kalopanayioti<br />\r\nCyprus Theatre Organisation<br />\r\nDepartment of Antiquities<br />\r\nKalavasos Municipality<br />\r\nA.B Seahorse Film Productions Ltd<br />\r\nLumiere Services<br />\r\nARRI Berlin<br />\r\nKodak Berlin<br />\r\nPetopia Petshop<br />\r\nCamel Park Mazotos<br />\r\nPaphos Zoo\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nSponsors:<br />\r\nPHC Franchised Restaurants Ltd\r\n',NULL),(213,0,'2016-04-07 14:09:21','2017-05-26 11:05:47',220,'FILM',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'film-stills-and-credits',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nStills from *Chapters*',NULL),(214,0,'2016-04-07 14:46:54','2016-04-28 16:54:53',223,'4 CHANNEL VIDEO INSTALLATION',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4-channel-video-installation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(215,1,'2016-04-07 14:48:11','2017-05-26 16:37:08',223,'CHAPTERS: INSTALLATION',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'video-installation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(216,1,'2016-04-07 15:10:01','2017-05-26 20:19:33',245,'MUSEUM OF NOTHING, MAA-PALAIOKASTRO',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'museum-of-nothing',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nAndrea Bruno, Museum of Nothing, 1989.',NULL),(217,0,'2016-04-11 17:07:08','2016-04-11 17:12:40',NULL,'SOCIOPOLITICAL EVENTS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'sociopolitical-events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'\r\nShooting Star\r\npine, glass \r\nA shooting star is a trading signal used to predict price movements.

She selects the variables that she believes to be most pertinent to the issue at hand and maps their correspondence with one another according to the available evidence. These relationships are then used to predict a spectrum of potential future outcomes. Economists ignore complexity. They have to. It would be impossible to include all possible factors in their paradigms. They abstract, smooth away and scale down the real world in order to present it as, to some extent, predictable. \r\n\r\nEvery economic model is riddled with bias. There is no neutral method for selecting the relevant factors. The other-things-being-equal assumption on which all such schemes are founded requires an act of self-deception. These models are made to determine policy, but perhaps there is also psychological motivation behind their reductions. In ignoring messy reality in favour of making neat mock-ups economists find ways of managing our and their anxieties.\r\n\r\nAn economist’s model has something in common with a dollhouse or a miniature railway. It is an approximation of the real world that allows its creator to have a sense of control. Children test their ideas about the world by playing God with dolls and latterly with digital characters. Likewise, adults who find the world difficult to comprehend can find refuge in elaborate train sets. In his book *The Savage Mind*, published in 1962, the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss argued ‘the intrinsic value of a small-scale model is that it compensates for the renunciation of sensible dimensions by the acquisition of intelligible dimensions.’\r\n\r\nA Japanese *suiseki* rock could find a place within a model railway or near a dollhouse, but the impulse behind its school of miniaturisation is different. *Suiseki* rocks are selected for their resemblance to other, usually larger scale, natural features such as mountain ranges or islands, but the relationships are suggestive, not exact. There is a huge range of different categories of suiseki, including not only rocks that look like mountains close up – *kinzan-seki* – and mountains in the distance – *enzan-seki* – but also those that bring to mind waterfalls – *yamagata-taki-ishi* – caves – *dokutsu-ish* – and even fish – *uogata-ishi* – or birds – *torigata-ishi*. Suiseki are not made or modelled, rather they are recognised. A *suiseki* is not a simplification, it is a kind of analogy. It prompts meditation on what one form might reveal about another. \r\n\r\nThe central piece in Michael Anastassiades’s exhibition *Reload the Current Page* is titled *Jimbutsu-seki*, which is the name for a suiseki stone that evokes the form of a human body. Unlike a suiseki, however, this piece was crafted, not discovered. It is carved from black basalt, a volcanic stone common in Cyprus, according to the dimensions of the Pentadaktylos mountain mass, part of the Kyrenia mountain range that runs parallel to the northern coast of the island. Consisting of five finger-like projections, Pentadaktylos is the best-known section of the Kyrenia mountains to the extent that it is often taken to be synonymous with the entire range. Its resemblance to a hand has generated numerous myths and it is variously said to be a handful of earth that was flung at or pushed toward an enemy or the handprint of the island’s saviour as he emerged from the sea. These myths have accrued resonance over the last forty years – since 1974 when the mountains were suddenly on the Turkish side of the island – yet have remained highly visible from the Greek. Pentadaktylos can be seen from the island’s divided capital Nicosia.\r\n\r\nMichael Anastassiades was a child when Cyprus was partitioned in 1974. He grew up in the shadow of the conflict and as a young adult served 24 months in the military – the period that remains compulsory for Greek Cypriot men – imagining various conflict scenarios. Had he remained in Cyprus, he would have been obliged to keep a gun in his home to use against invaders. For Michael, as for many Cypriots, Pentadaktylos loomed large both literally and figuratively. It was as if the island was waving at them from beyond enemy lines. \r\n\r\nThe Greek-Turkish conflict remains live, but times have changed. Currently the Cypriots’ most pressing concern is the state of the island’s finances. Yet somehow one crisis has merged into another and national anxieties have become non-specific. In taking the emotionally resonant and physically reminiscent form of Pentadaktylos and scaling it down, Michael has made an emblem for all of the islanders’ concerns. *Jimbutsu-seki* embodies both the Greek Cypriots’ fears of invasion and their unease about economic collapse. While the act of miniaturisation and simplification usually implies some kind of manageability, in this case worries are represented, perhaps even mitigated some, but the underlying problems remain stubbornly unsolved. \r\n\r\nWhile the landscape represented in *Jimbutsu-seki* has a basis in physical reality, the landscape suggested by another of the pieces in the exhibition, *Economic Sentiment Indicator*, is purely imaginary. Following the line of a graphic representation of Cypriots’ perceptions of their economic state from 2008 to 2013, the piece was CNC (computer numerically controlled)-carved from sandstone. The chart on which it was based is striking. In line with global sentiment, economic optimism in Cyprus plummeted in late 2008, then it held on and even rallied a little, only to plunge dramatically in mid-2011 during the time of the Greek government’s debt crises. From there the fall is pretty steady until the first quarter of 2013. On 25 March 2013 the Cypriot government accepted a ten-billion-euro international bailout that came with a number of extremely stern conditions. Many ordinary Cypriots lost a significant proportion of their savings. At that point, unsurprisingly, Cypriot economic sentiment took a nosedive.  \r\n\r\nAnastassiades’ miniature three-dimensional graph of this tumult is a lovely thing. In spite of plotting financial woes, it looks like a model of a place you might want to spend your holidays. A boom becomes a hill you could clamber up and a recession a valley you could roll into. As yet there are no suiseki categories for the representation of emotional states, but such a thing doesn’t seem unfeasible. There are certain sorts of rocks that imply pattern or texture—for example, *tori-ishi*, a stone that resembles a tiger pelt, or *raiko-seki*, a stone that suggests a lightening bolt. Why not a stone that brings to mind optimism or gloom?\r\n\r\nCyprus has a serious long-term problem with its water supply. This has been exacerbated by lack of cooperation and in some cases outright competition between the Greek and Turkish sides of the island. With both sides competing to tap scarce underground streams, there is even talk of a ‘water war’. The proposed solution on the Greek side is desalination plants and on the Turkish an undersea pipe bringing fresh water from mainland Turkey. Both will be expensive and difficult to engineer. In the meantime, Cypriots monitor the level of water in their existing reservoirs obsessively and anxiously. Kouris is the largest dam on the island and it creates a reservoir that collects water from four different rivers. In good times this is a ‘Y’ shape, stretching deep into the valleys in the north, but in moments of drought it is reduced to a small uncertain ‘l’.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of expressing this perpetual concern, Anastassiades has made three ‘water tables’. Their titles are a series of dates – 150321011, 15032012 and 15032013 – and the surface area of each table is a to-scale representation of the Kouris Reservoir on those three days carved in Cypriot sandstone. The dates mark the various stages in Cyprus’s economic crisis: March 2011 was a critical month in the Greek government’s debt crises that sent a shudder down the Cypriot spine. In March 2012 Cyprus’s credit rating was reduced to junk status, and March 2013 was the month of the aforementioned international bailout and the imposition of its punishing conditions. Between 2011 and 2013 the economic situation in Cyprus only got worse, but by contrast the water reserves actually improved. In 2011 the Kouris reservoir was reduced to a thin ribbon, but by 2013 it had more than doubled in size. The tables are respectively 1.164 meters and 1.9 meters long. The relationship between natural and economic resources is of constant concern for economists. Notably, famines are less likely the outcome of bad harvests, than of poor distribution, inequality and corruption. Cyprus’s need for water is inarguable, but rain alone cannot solve the problem. In order to reach an effective and lasting solution, the islanders must address the political and economic dimensions of the problem. \r\n\r\nWhile Cypriots worry about water, they distract themselves with football. The British introduced the sport to the island in the early 20th Century and Cyprus’s football league was founded in the early 1930s. Since then it has become the island’s consuming passion, so much so that the idea that football is merely entertainment would be an anathema to many Cypriot fans. Some teams are allied to political parties and the sense that supporters are siding with the right or the left adds heat to the competition. The island’s teams have enjoyed triumphs that are disproportionate to their resources, with the most successful of them all, APOEL, reaching the Champions League competition several times. \r\n\r\nAnastassiades evokes this enthusiasm through the titles of two of the pieces in the exhibition: *Keepie Uppie* and *Foul*. Both are CNC-carved sandstone models of a series of hills that drivers see en route from Nicosia to Larnaca Airport, which has served as the island’s major airport since the Turkish invasion put the newly constructed Nicosia Air Terminal out of action forty years ago. *Keepie Uppie* is simply a 1.5-meter-long representation of a series of peaks. *Foul*, meanwhile, is a model of three peaks on two of which, in reality, sit a church and United Nations military outpost. Instead of modelling these features in the piece, however, Anastassiades has placed an opaline sphere in the valley between the three hills. Again there is a suggestion of suiseki. Football fans channel life’s messy tapestry of joy and despair through a single simple channel. By connecting the peaks and troughs of the island’s landscape with the notion of sporting and political fortune, he implies that the sentiments of the football supporter might be more complex than they appear.  \r\n\r\nThe most personal of all the pieces in this exhibition are *Large Zap* and *Small Zap*. Both approximate spheres made from rough Cypriot stone, they are respectively 300mm and 45mm in diameter. When Michael was a teenager, his father commissioned a house from Cyprus’s most respected architect, Neoptolemos Michaelides. Born on the island in 1921, Michaelides studied in Milan both immediately before and after the Second World War and he is known for combining austere modernist form with local craft traditions. Michaelides became a mentor to Anastassiades and the two of them would go on outings to look at architectural and geological sites. On one such trip, Michaelides handed Anastassiades a stone that was a near-perfect sphere, which Anastassiades has kept to this day. This same stone is *Small Zap*, while *Large Zap* is the same thing scaled up several times. The larger the form becomes, the more apparent it is that it’s not quite spherical. \r\n\r\nWhile reduction and simplification are used to render things manageable—from economic relationships to train networks—magnification is employed to create complexity and reveal hidden truths. It is all a matter of perspective and proportion. It’s all about scale. Significantly, in this exhibition Anastassiades reduces the features of Cyprus as a whole, but enlarges the small piece of the island that he has kept as a souvenir these past 25 years. It’s interesting that he feels safe to expand and explore his personal connection with Michaelides, but, when it comes to the state of the nation, he feels the need for reduction and containment. \r\n\r\n(Emily King)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nII:\r\n\r\nHe spread out the drawings, photocopies, and photos on the long wooden table, and glanced up at me, his eyes brimming with a familiar combination of innocence and awareness that sets him apart.\r\n\r\n‘I felt the need to create something from the beginning,’ he told me, referring to his desire to engage in a ‘creative dialogue’, and to facilitate a shared but altered observation of reality through a balanced journey of discovery. He had lately been driven by an increasing realisation that, in order to be able to hold up the mirror to ourselves, we need to look closely at others around us. \r\n\r\n‘Believe in yourself.’ That had been his advice to me, time and time again, and he repeated it as we walked along snowy London streets some months ago. Bundled in long coats and woolly scarves, we talked about upheaval and new beginnings, about taking chances and re-defining ourselves. Naturally, at the forefront of our minds was the financial crisis, whose rippling effects had up-ended our convictions and played havoc with the notion of a ‘secure’ life. ‘Nothing is secure,’ he reiterated, ‘except your determination and your belief in yourself.’\r\n\r\nIn this latest endeavour, he had started afresh, seeing no reason to refer to his established recognition, or to flaunt his success. Certainly, he would have had every right to do so, considering how hard he has fought to defend that which defines and commends him. He has battled with the same demons that plague all those who decide to confront their fears and live their dreams, rather than simply dreaming their life away.\r\n\r\nI cherished the truth in those words, coming, as they did, from someone who knew first-hand what it meant to spend countless nights far from the comforting familiarity of your childhood home. In doing so, he had faced the unknown and had dealt with turmoil, having learnt the hard way that life is ultimately shaped by events seemingly beyond our control. Often, it is those events that push our limits and force us to change our point of view.\r\n\r\n‘So what do you mean when you say you want to “create something from the beginning”?’ I asked him later, on an evening out in Nicosia. As he sat opposite me, with a glass of red wine, he explained that he was seeking equilibrium between discipline and spontaneity. He nurtured the hope, he clarified, that current anxieties would give way to a more tranquil awareness. ‘It’s not random,’ he added, referring to his wish to return ‘home’ in order to share his experiences and his realisation that each end comes with a new beginning. ‘History repeats itself, and life isn’t a straight line,’ he said. ‘There is, though, something that stays constant throughout.’\r\n\r\n‘And what’s that?’ I asked. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t answer my question right away, delving instead into childhood tales of long walks with his friend Neoptolemos, where they would while away the hours searching for the perfect pebble, and of car journeys with his parents where the ‘scenic’ route was the only one available. He remembers sitting in the back, gazing out of the window at the three hills, a church and one red and one blue guard post perched on each hilltop. That was the point in time where paradox and contradiction defined his generation’s experiences as they wrestled with issues of separation and ghostly remnants, and where even the water level was a daily measure of our collective vulnerability. \r\n\r\n‘What stays constant?’ I insisted. \r\n\r\n‘The beauty that we find both inside and all around us,’ he replied. In order to appreciate it, he added, you have to ‘reload your page’ and filter the text, editing it and replacing it with language that values the essence of life, instead of trying to put a price on it. \r\n\r\n‘Is that what “reload” means?’ I posed the question, although I already knew that it means you can only trace reality with your fingertips once you’ve realized that the world is defined by your perception of touch. \r\n\r\nIt means gazing at the three rounded hilltops, having first understood that straight lines deaden the soul. It means placing your faith in a falling star, instead of wishing on one that shoots away. It means believing that, as long as life gives you the time to reload, there will always be beauty inside and all around us.\r\n\r\n‘So that’s the meaning of “reload the current page”?’ I asked once more. \r\n\r\nAnd this time, his answer was simply that same look, eyes brimming with a familiar combination of innocence and awareness.\r\n\r\n(Eleni Xenou)',NULL),(263,0,'2016-04-19 10:11:07','2016-10-18 21:48:25',83,'STORAGE',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'storage---state-art-gallery',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'State Art Gallery, Cyprus',NULL),(264,1,'2016-04-19 15:34:54','2017-10-16 15:32:23',196,'YIANNIS PAPADAKIS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'yiannis-papadakis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\nDr [Yiannis Papadakis](http://ucy.ac.cy/dir/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/papada) (b. 1964, Cyprus) studied Economics at the University of Cambridge, 1983–1986, and Philosophy at the University of California, Santa Cruz, 1986–1988.

Depending on the situation sketches can have several purposes - they might document or develop an idea, reflect something an artist sees, or function as a way of illustrating a concept, image or principle. For the artist, Panayiotis Michael, his videos, photographs, installations, interventions and objects function as sketches in the sense of unfinished or unresolved situations.\r\n\r\nThrough his work, the artist sketches images of uncertain realities. We see a pile of window frames titled Seven Window Frames(2013), a column constructed on a cushion in A Second Try (2013) or a framed landscape photograph fixed to the wall by a wooden-lath-construction in Landscape (2013). Panayiotis Michael’s pieces create strong visual images based on concentrated and simple set ups. Almost like parabolas or metaphors, his conceptual works tell universal and adaptable stories about the uncertainty of life. In this sense, the pile of window frames conveys not only a part of his parents’ unfinished house and personal memory, but talks more broadly about our vanished dreams and hopes. The complicated hanging of an image seems to be an ironic comment on the fact that we tend to lose sight of a simple solution, whether it is in our daily lives or in politics. It is this ability to transport private memories and experiences into a larger abstract image that is significant to his works. \r\n\r\nOften with a sense of humor, Panayiotis Michael consciously creates works of absurdity. Speed Fix (2013) shows a deconstructed chair perfectly balanced on its own seat and everyday objects like a level and masking tape. Viewers might be conflicted between the poetic beauty of the object and the absurdity of balancing a chair without function for the sake of balance only. In a similar way, Golden (2014) focuses on deconstructing gestures of measurement. Dating from the Renaissance, the “Golden Section” is considered to be the core of a perfectly balanced composition in a picture. Panayiotis Michael deconstructs this myth by literally displaying the calculation of this magical section on a wall in the exhibition. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the works of the artist oftenreveal processes or remain in flux rather than appearing in status quo. Much of his artistic practices involve the activation of processes, whether they are realized in a performance-like action by himself, Luxury Home 41 h2 (2013) and Luxury Home 41 h1 (2013), or by others, as, for example, the artist’s parents, who became part of the production process for the piece, Photograph (2012-2013). To focus on processes rather than a final product challenges the notion of control in artistic practice, and opens up once again the notion of uncertainty. \r\n\r\nPanayiotis Michael’s works often function as a projection platform for dreams, tragedies and hardships. This is probably most directly addressed in the work, Untitled (2013). This piece is a picture of a demonstration’s banner that is empty. Any form of protest, any form of outrage or wish can find its place on this banner. Similar to a time loop, this visual loop displays future, past and present at the same time, and stands symbolically for fights that have been fought, revolutions that are happening right now and proclamations that still need to be made. Panayiotis Michael’s works not only incite uncertainty but also invite viewers to feel, and fill them, with their own projections and solutions for balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNora Mayr\r\nIndependent curator and Co-director insitu, Berlin.\r\n',NULL),(278,1,'2016-02-22 16:26:34','2016-04-21 11:34:30',62,'\'ENTITLED\'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'panayiotis-michael-entitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'10.09. - 10.10.2014\r\n\r\nIn 10 September 2014 the exhibition entitled by Cypriot artist Panayiotis Michael opened at Point.

The [Künstlerhaus exhibition](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/bethanien-installation) is less gripped with the social happiness that a structure and its contents may signify, and more pleasurably associative in its flow of forms and metaphors, related, and not, to the artist’s family house, planned and never constructed. Vacant window edges are seductively abstracted in a horizontal line (age) of plank wood, hence, the piece’s title,[7 Window Frames](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/7-window-frames). Entities “belonging” to a house are taken apart into another time when they existed otherwise. Feather paddings quietly foster the history of a house, in [A Second Try](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2014/a-second-try), and enigmatic interiors weave remains of future memories in cabinets of curiosities. In the spaces of Künstlerhaus Bethanien, Panayiotis Michael creates an ambience, gracefully evoking moods prompted from what we feel entitled to experiencing. The show generously offers a leveling kind of playground from which no one seems to be in a favorable position to grasp the boundaries of a house of entitlement. Perhaps, the lost dream house of the child is not imagined as an enduring house of the future but as small, passing gestures of tranquil moods, where we can renegotiate our entitlements.

Much of his artistic practice involves the activation of processes, whether they are realised in a performance-like action by himself – *Luxury Home 41 h2* (2013) and *Luxury Home 41 h1* (2013) – or by others, as, for example, the artist’s parents, who became part of the production process for the piece *Photograph* (2012–13). To focus on processes rather than a final product challenges the notion of control in artistic practice, and opens up once again the notion of uncertainty. \r\n\r\nPanayiotis Michael’s works often function as a projection platform for dreams, tragedies and hardships. This is probably most directly addressed in the work *Untitled* (2013). This piece is a picture of an empty banner from a demonstration. Any form of protest, any form of outrage or wish can find its place on this banner. Similar to a time loop, this visual loop displays future, past and present at the same time, and stands symbolically for fights that have been fought, revolutions that are happening right now and proclamations that still need to be made. Panayiotis Michael’s works not only incite uncertainty but also invite viewers to feel, and fill them, with their own projections and solutions for balance.',NULL),(280,1,'2016-04-21 13:47:27','2017-04-19 20:53:16',166,'SOUND LIBRARY',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'sound-library',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nA collection of books, online texts and media exploring sound, listening, and experimental and contemporary music, selected by Yiannis Christofides, will be available for study throughout the exhibition.\r\n\r\n**Books**\r\n\r\n<br/>1.

[1] \r\n\r\nIf you still have some patience after the previous, very kind speeches, I could also add some words, especially for the young people.\r\n\r\nI believed in some ideas because I studied at the greatest school with no teachers: the *School of Kyrenia*. I spent my childhood there, full of experiences that have been part of my life since then. I still remember there were no playgrounds back then, no silly games to destroy children’s initiatives. \r\n\r\nThere was a ship in the old town of Kyrenia, the skeleton of a ship near Katsellis’ Hotel. [2] We used to sneak into it through a hole near its keel, climbing and thinking of long journeys, while watching Kyrenia’s sea, bluer than any other, through the ship’s black structure. Many years later I visited that place again: the ship wasn’t there. [3] I was wondering why, but no one could give me a proper explanation. I asked my friend, Andreas Kariolou, [4] if he would search for that ship while he was diving for sponges. \r\n\r\nNearby, mister Panagos the carpenter used to work with boats. We were young kids, full of excitement for a spectacle like that: a couple of workers sawing the thick planks of wood, making the parts of a new boat one by one. We desperately wanted to help, to feel like we were part of that process. \r\n\r\nLiving in Kyrenia and its stone alleys I remember in the wintertime walking upon the tiny colourful stones after the rain. Many years later, and after an analysis of myself, those stones became a part of my work. Without any intention of offending any aristocrat, I was originally blue-blooded: [5] all my father’s ancestors were deeply related to the sea. I remember captain Michalis -not Kazantzakis’ character- my uncle, [6] who introduced me to astronomy when we went up to the lighthouse and he showed me the Pole star with the rest of the stars around it. ‘What is that like in the daytime with no stars?’ I asked him. ‘Let me show you,’ he replied. \r\n\r\nAnd so he led me to the ship, *Archangelos*. He showed me the compass and I was spinning it around, but the needle was always showing North. These were my baby steps in astronomy. \r\n\r\nI was a student at a school were the headmaster was my uncle, George Karayiannis, who pinned ancient Greek dictums to the walls. We used to memorise them all, without actually understanding their meaning. I remember I once asked him to explain the meaning of *Midén ágan* (Nothing in excess), and he gave me a vivid example: ‘Think of a hook, so perfect we do not need to add anything.’\r\n\r\nIn Kyrenia we lived in an upper-storey house, which we were actually sharing with swallows. There was a nest underneath. My *steté* (grandmother) used to place a piece of newspaper in it for the bird droppings with four stones at the corners that I collected myself. We changed the paper and the stones every day. For us, that became an installation of great importance through the years. \r\n\r\nMy bedroom was oriented to the South, and I always insisted on leaving the window shutters wide open so that I could look towards the mountain, *Ayios Ilarionas*. I was excited, expecting lightning during those winter nights to show me the silhouette of the mountain. \r\n\r\nApart from *Tsiakkileri*, [7] I was also collecting stones from the mountain, using old tools to try to cut and smooth them and wet them so that I could see their grains. \r\n\r\nBack then there were no toys -we created them. The kites and the ships made by *anathrika*, [8] with a hen’s feather as a sail and an old blade as a keel to keep them floating. \r\n\r\nAs we were growing up, our ships improved, carved on wood with fabric sails. We used to through them up from the lighthouse when the west wind was blowing. We would run to the other side, where the dock was, competing against each other. \r\n\r\nI was sketching the old houses of Kyrenia with pencil on paper or on the back side of my uncle’s packets of cigarettes. \r\n\r\nThen I moved to Nicosia. I studied at the *Pancyprian Gymnasium*; new experiences, new context. We weren’t allowed to use the bike, because we lived in the old center of the town, so we went to school on foot. It was at that time when I started using watercolors. \r\n\r\nAfter my graduation from high school, I was determined to study architecture. My father was a tailor and, although he already knew about my decision, I remember him saying, ‘Within a year, when you will come back, regretful for your decision, please do not blame me for that.’ And after that: ‘You have two younger brothers.’  \r\n\r\nI knew that the word *architect* meant *the first among builders*. There was also a Chinese proverb I had heard years ago. It went like this: *I heard something and I think I remember it. I saw something and I remember it.* I made something and I know it. With that proverb in mind, I tried to construct whatever I could so that I would be more familiar with the builders’ language and with construction itself. \r\n\r\nFrom my first trip I brought back many stones and that caused me trouble at the customs office. I was lucky to meet Liperos Tsekkinis, a friend of my father -and co-worker of mine later on- who was a marble worker. He took those stones to his father, who cut them and burnished them, and it was then when I realised that what I was dreaming about was real: Pentadaktylos [9] was a mountain made of marble. \r\n\r\nThe Second World War began and I had to return to Cyprus after two years in university in Italy. I collaborated with George Paraskevaides back then. We built some houses, and I had the chance to observe how the builders worked, to learn many things from them that would help me later on as an architect. \r\n\r\nI used to sketch old houses as I was walking in Kyrenia, their flat roofs, their simplicity, the doors with the wooden parts, weathered by the rain. \r\n\r\nI went back [10] in 1947, after seven years of hiatus. During that period the British Council offered me a two-year scholarship for civil engineering studies. I told them I needed three years and they said, ‘Take that amount and we will see later about the rest.’ I asked them how was I suppose to pay off that scholarship, and they said that I would work in the government for five years and I could retire in thirty. ‘But then I will become a government employee,’ I said. “I have chosen to be an architect because I did not want to lose my freedom in any way.” When they informed me that I will not have any promotion, unless a senior employee retires, I immediately refused the scholarship, thinking that I didn’t want to pray for my senior’s death in order to get his position.\r\n\r\nDuring the war I worked on the project of the airport and the little money I earned would help me during my studies. I left Cyprus by boat -on the deck of course- and when I arrived in Italy I got another boat to Genova. It took me twelve hours to get to Milan by train. I began to study.\r\n\r\nI’d left Cyprus with a ‘suitcase’ full of experiences and questions, but also with a strong belief deeply cultivated since my childhood from those simple and plain Mediterranean houses.\r\n\r\nAfter I completed my studies in Italy, there were many good offers to stay there and an excellent proposal from a friend and classmate of mine, who invited me to Brazil. But I followed the lead of Odysseus, who did not stay on Calypso’s island. \r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Cyprus, the trend in architecture was to show off and bow to the client’s demands. I remember talking to the late Polis Michaelides, [11] an architect who had studied with Le Corbusier and who had built a house with Gothic arches near the Town Hall of Nicosia. When I asked him ‘Polis, how did you do that?’, he replied, ‘I copied the arches from the Doge’s Palace!” ‘Polis,’ I said, ‘I’m not commenting on *how* you did that, I just want to know the reason.’ ‘The clients were very rich and I just couldn’t refuse.’ I asked him whether his belief was based on his heart or his pocket. I …\r\n\r\n*The speech was interrupted*\r\n\r\nN. Michaelides: They say I need to end my speech.\r\n\r\nA. Stylianou: What we said, Mr. Michaelides, is that you have to conclude your thoughts, because we need to follow the schedule. \r\n\r\nN. Michaelides: But there is no timer here to give a warning. \r\n\r\nWe created a series of urban planning rules, but still with no mention about respecting the sun, whereas in the 5th century, in the city of Olynthos, there was a certain law forbidding any building from interrupting the insolation of another.\r\n\r\nTo the youngsters, I would like to say a few words: *They need to get to know our country, our real homeland. Not the one with those structures that are foreign to us, those 60-degree rooftops built on a drought-stricken island.*\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[1] The speech was transcribed and published in Greek in *Arhitekton* magazine, January/May 1992, issue 18, p.39.  <br />\r\n[2] *Dome* hotel was near the *First Tsiakkileri*, the last place where fishing boats and barges were constructed in Kyrenia. <br />\r\n[3] That ship was bought by Costas Katsellis, founder and owner of *Dome* hotel, in order to use its parts as firewood for the hotel’s cauldrons.

Objects, colours, feelings, and sounds intermingle not only so as to trigger old memories and create new ones, but also to unveil the view that ’the multitude of subjective interpretations’ and differences describing our world are the attributes of its wholeness and uniqueness. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the workshop was designed and delivered in partnership with the artist Yiannis Christofides.

Both the photographs as well as the objects on display invite the viewer to comprehend the architect’s continuous effort to carefully marry the international elements of modernism with local architectural characteristics. The educational workshop ‘Urban Footsteps’ was created upon and inspired by these notions. The local and the international/universal, the specific and the general, the small and the grand are all presented and perceived within the context of a relationship of interdependence rather than that of conflict.

The implementation of social responsibility projects and community outreach is often carried out through an institution’s education department.\r\n\r\nMuseums and galleries are no longer solely focused on what they present (collections and artworks), but also on their visitors and on ways to involve them in their practices. Galleries and museums have never before involved as many individuals through their diverse programming structures or fostered so many cross-institutional collaborations. This could, in fact, be interpreted as a direct result of the changing structure of funding mechanisms that have increasingly placed more emphasis on the involvement of diverse social groups and new communities. \r\n\r\nThe need to sing to the tune of multiculturalism has created museum and gallery educational narratives that aim to represent the voices of minority and marginalized social groups. At the same time, the notion of cultural diversity has been embraced by institutions even as the role of centres of art and culture in processes of regeneration and gentrification is acknowledged and accepted as a complicated one.\r\n\r\nThis conference, hosted by Point Centre for Contemporary Art and the University of Nicosia, is being organised in connection with Eleneio Elementary School within the framework of a local EEA-funded programme entitled *Promoting Anti-Discrimination through Arts Education for the Local Community*. The conference wishes to map out relevant knowledge and encourage scholars, professionals and practitioners to share good practices, educational and social theory, critical thinking, and on-the-ground expertise. \r\n\r\n<br/>Keynote lectures:\r\n\r\n‘Museum Education with Communities: Using feminist-hermeneutics to challenge prejudice and stereotype’ by [Dr. Viv Golding](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/viv-golding), President of ICME, Programme Director of Learning & Visitor Studies, Senior Lecturer in Communication and Education, School of Museum Studies, University of Leicester\r\n\r\n‘Poetic spaces = Ethical Languages: Laboratories of Art & Social Practice in Brazil’ by [Jessica Gogan](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/jessica-gogan), Director of Instituto MESA, Rio de Janeiro, PhD candidate in Art History at the University of Pittsburgh, USA\r\n\r\n<br/>Conference Abstracts [Wordcloud](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/international-conference)\r\n\r\n<br/>[Workshops](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/298)',NULL),(295,0,'2016-04-25 14:36:47','2016-04-28 18:15:54',156,'THE SOUND AND THE CITY: A SOUND WALK',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-sound-and-the-city-a-sound-walk',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Activity 1\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The first activity is initiated at the school’s premises, is carried out during the students’ transfer to the art centre and is completed upon arrival at the art centre.  \r\n\r\nWe commence by meeting the students at the school’s premises and introduce them to the artist (Yiannis Christofides). We ask students to imagine and discuss about the sound that represents each the most. E.g. «If you were a sound, which one do you think you would be? », «Is there a sound that could describe you or your personality? »\r\n\r\nThe artist encourages students to participate in a game that requires them to carefully listen and remember as many sounds as possible during the walk from the school to the art centre. E.g. « We are part of the city, but we never listen to what it has to say to us. Wouldn’t it be nice if today we let it talk to us? Let’s play a game – we will start by listening to the sounds close to us, we will try and remember them, and then we will attempt to hear the ones that are further away. Let’s see how many each of us can remember! » \r\n\r\nDuring the route from the school to the art centre the students can discuss between them any sound that catches their attention, but we also encourage them to reflect on their own. \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at the art centre, we ask students to respond to a set of questions regarding the set of sounds each managed to pick up. E.g.  «What kind of sounds did we listen to on our way here? », «What type of differences did these sounds have? », «Which sounds were strong and which ones appeared more subtle? », «Which sounds did you prefer? », «What kind of feelings do they trigger? »\r\n\r\nThe activity is completed with an explanation of what a sound walk is, i.e. the amassing of different sounds captured during a walk at a certain place.  \r\n',NULL),(296,1,'2016-04-25 15:33:08','2017-06-07 19:48:41',167,'VIV GOLDING',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'viv-golding',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\nDr. [Viv Golding](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/about-the-school/people/dr-viv-golding) received her PhD in Museum Studies from the University of Leicester, UK in 2000.

Treating the Museum as a largely untouched educational resource, the workshop is proposed as an opportunity for international experts to collaborate towards an open source, independently produced educational package that will be made freely available online. As a starting point, it proposes a re-reading of the collection through the lens of non-prescribed gendered identities, as well as issues of the body in a more general sense. Participants are invited to divide into teams and work freely together to consider and propose activities and ways the collection could be approached.

What would Nicosia look like and sound like to us if we could encounter it afresh, removed from pre-existing associations and memories?\r\n\r\nWe gave a camera and a sound-recorder to Eleneio Elementary students and let them circulate it amongst themselves. We invited those who were so inclined to put together visual and acoustic documentation of their experience of the city outside the school day.\r\n\r\nThrough our workshops we had previously encouraged the students to think about urban pockets, unnoticed architectures and soundscapes, social corners, hidden stories, and overlooked places. Within all this, we also encouraged them to think of ways to present their own voices and perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe video also makes use of soundmaps of Nicosia produced during workshops on Yiannis Christofides’ exhibition *The Blind Ear*.\r\n\r\n<br/>[Sound and light piece – play session](https://vimeo.com/164257161)\r\n\r\nFrom the workshop based on Yiannis Christofides’ exhibition *The Blind Ear*\r\n\r\nThis interactive piece was developed with Yiannis Christofides specifically for his sound installation *The Blind Ear*. It was an experiment in active listening that invited the students (and later, at Urban Gorilla’s Fouskopolis, the passersby) to respond bodily to an abstract soundscape.\r\n\r\nEarlier we used paper and paint to capture Yiannis’s sound-piece in colour. We then performed our painting using the sound-making properties of everyday objects, and with this final invitation to play, we used movement and light to translate the piece with our bodies.\r\n\r\nWe asked ourselves questions like: How would we go about translating these sounds with movement? If you were this sound what would you move like? What if sound and movement and colour where one single thing?\r\n\r\nThis piece asks us to consider how difference characterises a whole by combining colours and movements and responding to sound to create a fleeting sensory experience.\r\n\r\n<br/>[Intervention piece](https://vimeo.com/164249321)\r\n\r\nFrom the workshop based on Hélène Binet’s exhibition *Maria and Neoptolemos Michaelides Residence*\r\n\r\nWe encouraged the students to respond to Point Centre’s exhibition of Hélène Binet’s photographs of Neoptolemos Michaelides’ architectural work. We asked them to do so performatively and kinaesthetically, and to think about ideas of the house, the home and their structures. We invited them to draw on printouts of Binet’s images.\r\n\r\nFor this activity we asked the older students to choose a copy of an image they wouldn’t mind putting up in their bedrooms and to respond to a series of questions while circulating the copy of the image among themselves. \r\n\r\nThe questions were: Come up with five words that relate to the image. What is your favourite room in the house and why? What would you tell Nicosia if it were a person? In which cities or countries do you feel at home and why?\r\n\r\n<br/>[Magic carpet](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2015/point-eleneio-exhibition-magic-carpet)\r\n\r\nFrom the workshop based on Christodoulos Panayiotou’s exhibition *Stories from the Lives of My Friends*\r\n\r\nThis piece responds to Christodoulos Panayiotou’s piece *Operation Serenade*, made up of a rolled-up red carpet from the Oscars.

The workshops took a critical pedagogical perspective and attempted to engage with the students democratically, on a horizontal, dialogic, and collaborative basis, and to design creative learning activities that used as springboards their own interests and choice of subjects and engaged with their particular group dynamic.

Rowling’s [*Harry Potter*](https://www.pottermore.com). The starting point of the comparison is the epigraph from *Choephoroi* quoted in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. The paper starts with an analysis of the epigraph, tracing its connections to the plot of the *Harry Potter* books. This is followed by a comparison of the protagonists.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the focus is on the comparison of the cosmogonic tone of the works, which is closely related to the recurrent serpent and lion imagery. The analysis is based on close reading, contextual information and secondary readings. The comparison, aside from revealing the striking similarities between *Harry Potter* and the *Oresteia*, leads to the questioning of the restoration of order in both works.

Each of these two communities receives an education heavily oriented towards the so-called ‘mother country’, often neglecting our common history on this island. But in this way, not only is the history and background of the other community not taught, we also ignore a great number of other, much smaller but proud, communities living in Cyprus. This ignorance can lead to a distorted view of the island, its inhabitants and influences.\r\n\r\nVery few young people are aware of who or what the Maronites, the Armenians or the Latins are. In addition to these ‘other’ Cypriot communities, in the recent past, we have also seen a rise in the numbers of immigrants and refugees living among us—Syrians, Filipinos, Pakistanis, European Union nationals, Turks and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />Methodology:\r\n\r\nWe created a series of four informational animations titled *The People of Cyprus*, targeted mainly towards the youth. The main body of the work was carried out by students across the island and coordinated mainly by the [Cypriot Puzzle](http://www.thecypriotpuzzle.org), an informal youth group committed to informing and engaging the Cypriot public (mainly the youth) in constructive debate on the Cyprus Problem in its various manifestations. We contacted universities across the island and called students to contact us if they were interested. We created two teams of students (the ‘data team’ and the ‘design team’). This process took a month to be completed and the selected students were notified by mid-May.\r\n\r\nThe data team had four team members, two Turkish Cypriots and two Greek Cypriots, one of whom was a professional in the field and acted as a consultant for the data gathering. The design team consisted of five students and one professional animator, who acted as a consultant for the visualisation of the data gathered and the production of the animations. In both teams, members of the Cypriot Puzzle acted as coordinators and had little input in the actual production of the media content. Basically, the teams had considerable freedom and the Cypriot Puzzle acted as a facilitator of the whole process.\r\n\r\nA total of 26 individuals participated in the production of the four animated videos. A detailed list of names can be found in Appendix B. The whole project was carried out at the Point Centre of Contemporary Art, a space which was kindly given to us rent-free by the owner. From September onwards the production of the animated videos was carried out by professional animators and sound designers upon our request. You can find more information about them in Appendix B.\r\n\r\n<br />Data Research Team:\r\n\r\nThe data research started in mid-June and was completed by early July. There were two fulltime students researching *The People of Cyprus*, one part-timer and a professional who assisted the students. The first part of the research was devoted wholly to gathering data from governmental sources, particularly from the Census surveys. Unfortunately, the last census was carried out in 2011. Therefore, the data are representative of that year and cannot accurately depict the reality today. Up-to-date data, such as population figures, were difficult to find for 2015, and therefore all numbers in the videos should be viewed with caution and should only be used as approximations.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the research involved analysis of the data gathered from the census and other official sources. This analysis included, but was not limited to, the creation of population trends and graphs.\r\n\r\nThe last part of the research focused on an extensive list of secondary sources, such as articles, books and academic opinions. The data research team produced short summaries of the secondary literature and compiled them in a single document resulting in a 50-page report, which was then given to the design team, which used the most interesting material to produce the animation videos. Our data research team also visited academics from various institutions and had a chance to discuss and ask questions relevant to our research topic. A bibliography is provided at the end of this report, in Appendix A, outlining the official and secondary sources we consulted for our research.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to identify specifically which sources are used in each video, since the design team used as a reference the processed and analysed material of the data research team. The data research team carried out a quantitative analysis of all official/governmental data and generally of all data in numerical form and then carried out a qualitative analysis on secondary literature, which concentrated primarily on historical and cultural aspects of the people of Cyprus. All of the videos include data from both sets, i.e. the quantitative and qualitative data. All our sources are listed in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n<br />Design Team:\r\n\r\nThe Design Team started work in early July and finished by early August. First, the design team visited some museums, such as the Severis Foundation, in order to collect visual material that helped the team visualise the data gathered. In the first week the two teams worked together in order to finalise the animation scripts. The data research team provided and explained the analysis and process carried out on the raw data gathered. The rest of the time was spent designing, creating illustrations and ultimately converting them into animated media material with the aid of a professional animator and members of the Cypriot Puzzle, who facilitated the whole process. Most of the work of the design team took place at Point Centre of Contemporary Arts and we are very grateful for this gracious contribution from the owner.   \r\n\r\nWhen the Design team completed its work, the end products were given to a professional animator who carried out some minor adjustments and corrections. This happened between September and December 2015. The sound design and voiceover was recorded in November and the audio and visual were merged into the final product by early January 2016.\r\n\r\n<br />End Products:\r\n\r\nWe have created four animated videos, totalling eight minutes and consisting of high-quality illustrations. Moreover, we created a body of research material including analysis of quantitative data, such as population figures and other demographic data. We also produced summaries and abstracts of more than 50 secondary literature sources. We aim to make this research readily available to the general public for reference or further research on the subject. We also translated the English script into Turkish and Greek and made it available in the form of subtitles in the videos. \r\n\r\n<br />The Aim:\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project was to present the different communities currently living in Cyprus— their populations, languages, religions, times of arrival on the island, cultures, etc. Furthermore, we wanted to start a discussion about who the people of Cyprus really are, which we initially defined as anyone living in Cyprus for more than 2 years, and what each group’s respective role and stake is in the Cyprus conflict.  \r\n\r\nThe way we went about creating these videos was not simply as a means to an end. The process itself engaged youth from different communities who collaborated with one another. At the same time it gave them a chance to work on real life projects, improve their portfolio and learn about the Cyprus Problem by actually working on something relevant to it.\r\n\r\nThis project was undertaken by the Cypriot Puzzle, an informal youth group committed to informing and engaging the Cypriot public (mainly the youth) in constructive debate on the Cyprus Problem in its various manifestations. By looking at the island’s political problem as a puzzle of which each of us is a piece, we are helping bring to the foreground the multitude of opinions that define it. At the same time, we’re serving the aims and goals of our funding partners, Youthopia, since our videos raise significant issues regarding human rights and the rights of minorities on the island.',NULL),(311,1,'2016-04-27 10:57:39','2017-06-07 22:11:29',248,'FIRST ANNUAL CYPRUS CIRCLE: DEBATES',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'debate-i',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br/>\r\n<br/>09.07.2015, 20:00\r\n\r\n[Cyprus Circle I](https://vimeo.com/208752739)\r\n\r\n‘Will a truth commission investigating the 1963–74 atrocities help or hinder current solution attempts of the Cyprus Problem?’\r\n\r\nSpeakers: Dr Bulent Kanol, Dr Erol Kaymak, Dr Yiannis Laouris, Achilleas Demetriades\r\n\r\nModerator: Andromachi Sophocleous\r\n\r\n<br/>16.07.2015, 20:00\r\n\r\nCyprus Circle II\r\n\r\n‘Should Cypriot architecture be driven by context?’\r\n\r\nSpeakers: Dr Pavlos Philippou, Dr Rita Severis, Lora Nicolaou, Margarita Danou\r\n\r\nModerator: Branka Cuca',NULL),(312,1,'2016-04-27 11:54:32','2017-06-07 22:41:50',281,'THE DRUMHEAD: READINGS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'312',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nA series of readings by artist-in-residence Gerry Bibby \r\n\r\n<br />Press Release:\r\n\r\nBook Launch + PART I: Tuesday 10 November 2015, 19:00\r\n\r\nPART II: Sunday 15 November 2015, 16:00\r\n\r\nPART III: Friday 27 November 2015, 19:00\r\n\r\nAs might be readily assumed, the drumhead is the top, or head, of a drum. It has in times past come to perform the role of a mobile writing table, an ersatz altar, and a gathering point for orders to be heard when military campaigns were on the field.\r\n\r\nThe handsome sailor, Billy Budd, was sentenced to death by hanging after a drumhead court martial on the Bellipotent found him guilty in Herman Melville’s all-male story, taking its title from the condemned character. Melville began writing the novella *Billy Budd, Sailor*, in 1888. It was published posthumously in 1924.\r\n\r\nCommissioned by If I Can’t Dance, I Don’t Want to be Part of Your Revolution, and published by Sternberg Press last year, Gerry Bibby’s *The Drumhead* was written on the move. Natasha Soobramanien notes, ‘[It was] written in just six months, in six cities, in the space between three shows.’\r\n\r\nAlthough not as mobile as some media, the printed novel was compiled on a laptop. A lap is a lot easier to move around than a drum, and both it and a novel can find themselves in spaces they might never have expected to land. \r\n\r\nHenrik Olesen writes, ‘*The Drumhead* inaugurates a world of pure presence – (un)scrupulously amalgamating sexual politics, right-wing deliriums, and contemporary art.’\r\n\r\nAs one of the inaugural residents of Point Centre for Contemporary Art’s Residency Programme, artist Gerry Bibby will read the entirety of his novel over a series of gatherings at Point during his stay, the first of which will happen in the presence of Athens-based curator and fellow resident Evangelia Ledaki this Tuesday, 10 November 2015 at 7pm.

This fact can even be proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and one pricks up one’s ears and listens, say in the night, when everything round about is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror not quite firmly fastened to the wall.’\r\n\r\n– Franz Kafka, *The Blue Octavo Notebooks*\r\n\r\nMy practice involves paintings and drawings that deal with subject matter rooted in daily life and memory that feels both familiar and puzzling. A sense of precariousness emanates from the way memories co-exist and arrive at the present. The work attempts to make these experiences visible and to ground or to situate the viewer in relation to them. This is a starting point, through which themes of alienation, time, ritual and place emerge. The work is informed by a personal understanding of film and literature and ideas that emanate from them as they relate to experience.\r\n\r\nIn Yasujiro Ozu’s films, people’s lives are represented in such a way as to decentre the individual with regard to the objects that surround them, the rooms they inhabit, the cities they live in. Ozu’s pillow shots are particular film shots that serve no clear narrative function. They appear between scenes of dialogue and serve to transition from one scene of narrative information to the next. They operate both within a space relating to a linear, incremental projection of time relevant to the story, but also imply a sense of time independent from the narrative framework. \r\n\r\nThis suspended space, and the sense of time made possible as expressed within it, exist visibly and in relation to personal moments and suggest possibilities for reflection. I seek to activate, through personal subject matter, a sense of place, an apparently tangible yet fleeting presence.',NULL),(316,1,'2016-04-27 13:37:25','2017-06-07 23:24:28',295,'THOSE THAT BREAK ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'those-that-break',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nby Evangelia Ledaki\r\n\r\n<br />*Things that break*\r\n\r\nDistinction and division unavoidably lead to a process of loss. Parallel to the distinction itself, a transition takes place during which the divided entity reaches a dual state of understanding, a self-definition which includes an unavoidable crack and leads to the fragmentation of data. The two occurrences, the incision and the distinction, are not synonymous, they are interconnected, the second presupposing the first.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘distinction’ states a process. It creates the image of a movement – a piece distancing itself from another piece. Then the two remain distanced, standing still at a distance, each one separately. This position – to be accurate, these two positions, as well as the space between them – comprise what we call civilisation. Civilisation is defined through difference. Civilisation is, if we imagine it as a metaphor, like things that break. If things didn\'t break, we wouldn\'t have the world as we know it.\r\n\r\n<br />*There are some things that break*\r\n\r\nSome things are especially fragile, and even though not all things break, those that do cannot escape this fate. Such things are human relations. Not only relationships and friendships, but also alliances, agreements, compromises. All these things will crack at some point and sometimes will break. Independently of whether there is the chance of future reconciliation of the two surfaces of a broken thing, nevertheless it is established that this possibility is sporadically attempted. It was accepted that it must be confirmed whether they continue to fit together and consequently merge again, since they had, at a previous point, undergone an incision and in time seemed incompatible. In time, one might say that it seems impossible that these two surfaces were once compatible.\r\n\r\n<br />*Cyprus (one or two)*\r\n\r\nSomething similar perhaps happened with Cyprus. Any random Internet surfer or an almost clueless listener of international news might rationally wonder, ‘How many Cypruses are there?’. The question is not completely without basis, even if it suggests a certain, perhaps inexcusable, distance from things. The island itself is certainly an entity which cannot break. This is an unquestionable fact, which allows some kind of disturbance: the island, even if it is geographically a mass, has undergone other forms of breakage. In the specific case, the island has been divided. Among the various opinions, expectations and developments that have come about through various factors, there has also been a noticeable line applied to the ground that has since been called the Green Line. It is said that the Green Line was etched as a small accent by the hand of a British commander on a map in 1963, because there were some events between the communities that were to be settled in this manner. All the inhabitants today know the history, but few realise that this line in reality looks more like a dense adhesive substance, like glue, rather than a boundary.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the island\'s capital, I stayed for a time near the Green Line. At the time I had not yet managed to form this useful image, which would have given my approach a rather cheerful attitude. On the contrary, I was in the awkward position that you find yourself in when dealing with something so intensely that you close yourself up in thought and time goes by slowly and without variation; where you almost cannot do anything else other than think of the one and only thing that you are dealing with, the object that rules your attention—and you can’t even admit that it interests you. At these moments I usually sat on the couch somewhat bored, thinking incessantly of the line until at some point the phone rang. While on the phone, I watched the TV, sometimes at low volume, which did not allow me to follow the speakers, and sometimes on mute. Most times, the news was on. I preferred Euronews because there was a programme which, without having timed it, I had the sense was repeating every seven minutes, and this repetition gave me great pleasure and functioned as an unofficial measurement of time. Whatever the case, one thing was for sure: I was not concentrating on the speakers on the phone. Between the two distractions, that of the TV and that of the phone, my concentration was attempting to remain focused on the informal object of my interest. And it is a fact that Euronews, with all its explicit images of bombardments, plane crashes, suicide bombings, mass wailing, grief and so on, kept me levelled as far as the enigma and the dead end I was experiencing in relation to the line. During all this, I was visualising a powerful image: I was going down a road, Ledra Street, and passing a small canopy, and the other canopies that were placed in order, not noticing the subtle signs. But even so, this moment I was so actively picturing in my head was not occurring. Only the image remained and repeated itself intensely, disturbing every other thought and errand, especially at times when I was home alone.\r\n\r\nI remember the first week, I heard the muezzin a little after 11 am. In the beginning I stood, focused my attention on the sound, then opened the window. Many times I didn’t do anything until the voice stopped; I observed it, listened carefully. After a few weeks, I don\'t remember even noticing it at all. Maybe I could no longer hear it, which even now impresses me. I cannot recall any moment in the past few days in that apartment when I stood to listen to the call for prayer from the other side of the line. I only remember that the days were going by and I continued to estimate possible routes that would lead me to the one or other spot I had found on the map or that I had discovered on the Internet, and as I sank into my thoughts, the image of the canopied road seemed more distant, and the line became more impenetrable and more visible. It was a merging that remained raw and if you tried even in your mind to cross it, your feet would stick to the green surface.\r\n\r\n<br />*Finally, the vertical route*\r\n\r\nThree weeks went by before I crossed for the first time. They seemed like months. When I eventually reached the other side, a tall thin man greeted me. He was not a stranger, he had been waiting for me and maybe I was a bit late. If he had not invited me that afternoon, I probably would never have gone. I know that this is not entirely true though. I would have certainly gone at some point, but it is not clear to me how, when and why. All this, of course, makes no difference because on that afternoon, I went.\r\n\r\n<br />*The text written afterwards*\r\n\r\nAs I was writing this small text, I thought of Simon, who I met in South Africa and with whom we discussed his own things that break and the apartheid as ‘aparthood’ in comparison to neighbourhood. Looking back on those conversations, I looked up *neighbourhood* in the dictionary.[1] The instance of close co-existence. And *aparthood*.

Its basis is the *Theory Of Open Form*, with a concept related to visual arts. It was designed by Polish architect, artist and theorist Oskar Hansen.\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the *Theory Of Open Form*, the artist with his/her gesture does not create a closed work of art, but builds an opportunity for the context and for interpretation. Open Form work is always ready to be present in other circumstances and conditions, in another time, and in another relationship with reality. It postulates classless society, egalitarianism, absence of hierarchical pattern, democracy, non-dogmatism, and decentralisation. Art in the convention of the Open Form respects the personality of the author and the personality of the viewer, and creates conditions and spaces for them to reflect. During the creation of work an ordinary human with his/her capabilities and skills can be the driving force.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hansen, the Open Form could be the ‘realism of our time’, and the role of the artist in it is to find the ‘personality’ and ‘identity’ of each and every person in order to prevent chaos. An emphasis is placed on everyone’s own creative individuality and sensitivity, since everyone is an author of the collective.\r\n',NULL),(333,0,'2016-05-03 10:29:58','2017-06-07 22:33:23',269,'VHS FESTIVAL: SPECIAL SCREENING',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'special-screening-vhs-festival',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\n17.09.2015, 20:00\r\n\r\nPress Release:\r\n\r\nThe first Cypriot VHS Festival will happen on 17 September 2015, with a special screening at Point Centre for Contemporary Art (free entrance).

The subject is broad hence the choice of a theme is problematic.

Socratis is a long-time friend of Point, a relationship cemented when he represented [Cyprus at the Venice Biennale in 2009]. As assistant curator of the national pavilion, Andre managed to procure, on Socratis’s request, an [Indian snake charmer](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/indian-snake-chramer) to live and perform in Venice for the duration of the event.  \r\n\r\nSocratis creates several dozen sandcasts of everyday objects. In the month before the exhibition, he passes by Point almost every afternoon to update Andre on the progress of the work via [photographs]() of his most recent creations. Once in the gallery, he takes several days to arrange the pieces into a [constellation of compositions]() on the lower floor. At first the plethora of objects that don’t make the final cut are packed way in the basement, but later they are retrieved and displayed in the form of an extensive [archive](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/catalogue) in the upper gallery. Point’s usual baker is unable to supply goods for the private view, so Socratis himself bakes a feast of olive and halloumi koulouri in various shapes and sizes: an edible echo of the abundance of works in the show.  \r\n\r\nThe exhibition closes on 16th July.\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot summer sets in. \r\n\r\nBetween the 10th and 18th September Point hosts [*Plus Motion: Live performance art series*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/plus-motion-live-performance-art-series), the first performance art event staged by the artists’ collective [Sensorium Space](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/sensorium-space). On 9th September at 7pm four artists’ activities take place in the galleries. Various props are used including a wooden plank, branded sports bags, china tea cups of various patterns, a feather, red string and a ram’s skull. The aim is to “reach the outer limitations of a physical and mental exhaustion” for both performer and viewer. \r\n\r\nThe artist [Lito Kattou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/lito-kattou), a graduate of the Athens School of Fine Art and a student the Royal College of Art in London, proposes a project on the theme of [“new materialism”](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/matters-as-pleasures-forces-as-things-bodies-as-matters). Encompassing both a collaboration with architects connected to the digital curating project at the [Cyprus Institute](https://www.cyi.ac.cy) and a duo of guest lectures, its first manifestation is a visit by the writer [Federica Bueti](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/federica-bueti). Not only speaking for four hours on the theme of [*Matter as a Wondering Substance*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/matter-is-a-wandering-substance) on the 1st October, Federica also undertakes a series of studio visits during her stay in Cyprus. It is a fruitful, if somewhat exhausting few days. \r\n\r\nResponding to the second of the invitations initiated by Lito, the curator of the Kassel\'s Fridericianum [Susanne Pfeffer](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/susanne-pfeffer) arrives in Cyprus on the 24th November. She spends two days exploring the island, taking in its archaeological past, its political present, its food and its art scene. On 26th November she gives a [talk](https://vimeo.com/213121044) on her work in Kassel in the upper gallery. Meanwhile, in the lower gallery, Lito creates a digital installation titled [*Whistles of Surfaces*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/whistles-of-surfaces) with her architect collaborators [Eftychios Savvidis](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/eftychios-savvidis) and [Charalampos Ioannou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/charalampos-ioannou). The work is experienced through an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality device. According to the trio, the piece involves a collection of artworks that “inhabit the digital space as sound versions of their visual form dispersed in the environment as sonic areas.”\r\n\r\nBetween the 14th and 28th October Point hosts the Xarkis Festival’s first exhibition. [Xarkis](http://xarkis.org/) is an organisation that “envisages a Cypriot citizenry that is active, participatory and socially engaged.” The exhibition encompasses material from the [annual festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qporw-txems) and reflections on that event. Among Xarkis’s aims is to explore links between contemporary art and design with folk and vernacular culture.\r\n\r\nArriving on the 17th October the artist duo [Julia Rometti and Victor Costales](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/julia-rometti-victor-costales) take residence. Almost perpetually in residence somewhere or other, the couple have no fixed abode, although for administrative purposes they live in Mexico City. In Nicosia they stay in a two-bedroomed apartment in the Old City. Over several weeks they explore the island and the city. Their idea for a piece, which will become part of a group exhibition *completely something else* curated by Jacopo Crivelli Visconti, is to project shadows cast by leaves on a set of curtains within the galleries. An echo of the shadows cast by leaves as the morning sun strikes Point’s wall-to-wall window, the piece also relates to a previous work by the artists. \r\n\r\nOn the 4th November [Petros Moris’s](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/petros-moris) solo show [*Transformation of Commons*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/transformation-of-commons) opens. Described as “an evolving visual [essay](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/perpetual-prologue) […] that negotiates the transformative interrelations and the mutual stratifications of the material, technological and cultural environment”, it is created in collaboration with the Cyprus Institute, in particular with Professor [Nikolas Bakirtzis](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/nikolas-bakirtzis) who joins Petros for the opening [lecture](https://vimeo.com/212315907). In his initial proposal Petros writes, “The potential product of this artistic research is understood to be the combinational and structural production of textual work and visual systems, introduced as aesthetic interfaces exploring the relationships between digital and materiality, phenomena of the infrastructure and the archive, as well as the processes of knowledge production and cultural translation between Informational typologies and aesthetic forms.” In the gallery he displays ghostly renderings of archaeological objects. \r\n\r\nThe show closes on the 26th November.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th November the artist [Maria Loboda](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/maria-loboda) joins Julia and Victor in residence, moving into the same flat. Maria is interested in the plaster-casts of classical elements that are a feature of many Cypriot homes. Her work, a collaboration with fellow artist [Constantin Thun](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/constantin-thun) who joins her later, also becomes part of the exhibition ‘completely something else’.\r\n\r\n[*completely something else*](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/completely-something-else), a group show curated by [Jacopo Crivelli Visconti](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/jacopo-crivelli-visconti) opens on December 3rd. It is Point’s first group show and also its first exhibition to be advertised on [e-flux](http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/81268/completely-something-else/). \r\n\r\nBased in Brazil, Jacopo makes his first trip to Cyprus in May 2016. He visits archaeological sites and artists’ studios, among them that of [Angelos Makrides](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/angelos-makrides), a Cypriot artist born in 1942. Jacopo encourages Angelos to show his early conceptual work. Initially the artist is reluctant, but finally he relents. Two works from 1962, both wall hangings made from found wood, will become part of Jacopo’s exhibition. \r\n\r\nJacopo returns to Cyprus on the 28th November to spend a week installing the show. “This is not an exhibition about Cyprus”, he [writes in the gallery guide](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/text-by-jacopo-crivelli-visconti), “it aims at recreating an atmosphere rather than directly addressing a place, theme or a topic.” “A small displacement can change everything,” he concludes.\r\n\r\nAll the artists - Haris Epaminonda, [Mario García Torres](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/mario-garcia-torres), [João Maria Gusmão and Pedro Paiva](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/joao-maria-gusmao-pedro-paiva), [Phanos Kyriacou](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/phanos-kyriacou), Angelos Makrides, [Tiago Mestre](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/tiago-mestre), Maria Loboda and Constantin Thun, Christodoulos Panayiotou, Julia Rometti and Victor Costales, [Daniel Steegmann Mangrané](http://dev.o-r-g.com/point/annual-reports/2016/daniel-steegmann-mangrane) – attend the opening.\r\n\r\nJulia, Victor and Maria all leave Cyprus on the 6th December.

Phenomenological ideas have been influential in various fields relating to the arts such as architectural theory (e.g. in the work of Christian NorbergSchulz), the theorisation of acousmatic music (e.g. in the theoretical work of Pierre Schaeffer), literary theory (in particular through the influence of hermeneutics), visual art, poetry, drama, film, etc.\r\n\r\nThe seminars will begin by introducing basic concepts in the phenomenological tradition, and move on to a careful reading and group discussion of a selection of texts that relate phenomenology to the arts. Texts in the phenomenological tradition are often notoriously difficult to read, and require some guidance.\r\n\r\nThus, the seminar conveners will give a series of presentations that will acquaint the participants with the background of each text. These presentations will lead up to a series of group discussions in which the participants will discuss the texts from various perspectives, including those informed by more practical concerns regarding the arts.\r\nThe seminars are addressed to anyone interested in the arts broadly conceived (i.e. including music, architecture, dance, literature, film, etc), art theory, or philosophy. They will take place twice a month over a period of 6 months. They will commence on the second week of February 2016, and will run until the third week of July 2016. Each seminar will last for three hours. \r\n\r\nThe seminars are organised by Point Centre for Contemporary Art, where they will take place.

Can you explain what motivated that project, where it came from?\r\n\r\nSocratis Socratous: I started to work on that project after an event which took place in August 2006 in the northern part of Cyprus1. \r\n\r\nThousands of palm trees had been imported there from neighbouring Africa, Egypt more precisely, as part of an attempt to add a more exotic, eastern feel to the local environment. Almost as soon as planting started along the northern coast, stories began emerging. Rumour had it that cobras’ eggs were hidden in the roots of these trees and what’s more, that these eggs had started to hatch.\r\nThe climatic conditions were ideal for the survival of the reptiles, and as snakes are not bound by political frontiers, the fear grew that they would be able to move freely to the other side of the island. The whole story remained stuck in my mind and I began a project centred on it, which I called *Naja Haje*, a work in progress. I first presented it in July 2008 in Paris in the context of *Paris/ Chypre - La Saison Culturelle Européenne*, and then the same year in Thessaloniki during *Action Field Kodra*.\r\n\r\nThis seemingly trivial incident with the cobras gave me a chance to explore and discuss the political situation on my island, Cyprus, where the two ethnic communities, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot, remain to this day separated by outside forces against their will, seemingly unable to find a way to coexist. Their political leaders are caught in a perpetual cycle of negotiations, with no obvious end in sight.\r\n\r\nS.D. What did your project consist of in Paris and Thessaloniki, and how did you develop it for Venice?\r\n\r\nS.S. In Paris, I showed a series of photographs in an art gallery about the story of the snakes and palm trees. I also staged a performance in a boat where there is a bar and a restaurant moored along the banks of river Seine. People gathered in the boat and they were shown a video on the theme of the cobras and the palms.\r\n\r\nThe curtains fell and when they came up, spectators were confronted with the arrival of a small boat carrying a palm tree, which was desperately trying to draw up alongside the big boat. Suddenly, it was no longer clear in people’s mind whether the whole story was going to come true or if it was all a masquerade. They never found out, since the small boat never managed to reach the one they were on. Then a girl recited a poem by the Greek Nobel Prize winner Giorgos Seferis *The Cats of Saint Nicholas* (1969)2, which has a lot of politically loaded metaphors.\r\n\r\nIn Thessaloniki, I showed a photo installation and a video, and I also did a performance. I was on a small boat together with a big palm tree, and we were tugged along by a larger boat. We moored at a dock where there was an actor who had just finished reciting the poem. She got on the boat and we left.\r\n\r\nFor Venice, I initially imagined a more complex project in three parts. The idea of a boat with a palm tree is still present. The boat is drifting along various canals in the city during the first five days of the Biennale’s opening. The interior and exterior of the boat are entirely decorated with graphics and there is a crew. \r\n\r\nThe tree is an Egyptian date palm, and the way it is mounted on the deck of the ship makes it look like an emerging cannon. The tree seems to be looking for a place to be planted -which should be the destiny of every tree. \r\n\r\nIn the city there are two snake-charmers in their traditional outfits: you can see them wandering with their cobra baskets, carpets and pillows, while stopping to perform from one place to the next (preferably on top of wells, including at the Campo San Stefano, at the Piazzetta dei Leoncini, or on the Esplanade close to the Giardini).\r\n\r\nThey live inside the Cyprus Pavilion, on the second floor of Palazzo Malipiero, in a part of the flat. A visitor has access to their room, which looks like an Indian-style bedroom, but can only see it through a glass window. They will be staying here for the duration of the Biennale looking after the snakes, which will be kept in a cage specifically designed for them.\r\n\r\nThe third aspect deals with transmission and the circulation of news, stories, and information about the project. It not only involves people intervening in various places (and you cannot be sure whether they are actors or people who, for one reason or another, feel implicated in the problematics surrounding the project and are reacting spontaneously).\r\n\r\nIt also involves all kinds of transmission “props”: flags, posters, flyers, newspaper ads, internet (the creation of a website with viral e-mails with people sending them to their contacts, thus generating a large number of unverified messages about the project).\r\n\r\nThese “props” deal with various versions and interpretations of the story, so that it is almost impossible to distinguish the truth from the untruth.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. What meaning do you attach to snakes and particularly cobras?\r\n\r\nS.S. Snakes are historically connected with Cyprus. It’s been said that in the 4th century AD, after a long period of water shortage (a phenomenon that still occurs today with water being shipped from Greece), snakes had infested the island.\r\n\r\nThen, Constantine the Great, together with Saint Helen -the first Byzantine emperors- sent a ship full of cats and set them loose to exterminate the reptiles. You can find echoes of this story in modern literature. In the aforementioned poem by Seferis, for instance, the author uses the metaphor of the snake to represent the evil conqueror, thus commenting on the political history of Cyprus. This poem is a very important part of my project. \r\n\r\nCobras are the co-stars of this project (together with the palm trees). The principal meaning I give them is that the cobras hatched in the northern part of Cyprus are crawling freely into the southern part, as if to unify the inhabitants of the island.\r\n\r\nSo the cobras, being snakes, are connected with the history of the island. But they also are imbued with many other meanings. In other religions and mythologies they have the place of a “royal” snake. Moreover the cobra is a snake-eating snake that feeds on its own species and can be found in almost all the neighbouring Middle Eastern countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. What does the boat meandering through Venice represent?\r\n\r\nS.S. The boat is part of the ritual. It is the medium which carries the history of the project (palm trees and cobras) and is connected with the boat that Constantine the Great sent, with the boat in the Seferis’s poem and even with the boats landing Turkish troops οn the island in 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. What is the significance of the palm tree?\r\n\r\nS.S. It is an uprooted tree that needs to be replanted somewhere. It is the starting point of the story and also a part of the whole ritual. The boat is carrying the palm tree, and the palm tree is carrying the cobras and their eggs. The tree’s positioning invokes the idea of threat. \r\n\r\nIt is a tree that is connected with exoticism. It could, associatively, connect with an immigrant looking for a new home. These new homes often lack the infrastructure to welcome them and can even be inhospitable most of the time.\r\n\r\nIn a photo documentation made in the northern part of the island, you can see these palms, tired and weather beaten, trying to adapt to the new environment.\r\n\r\nThe palm trees carry their own story and supposedly some kind of invisible danger which has the potential to spill over into their new home. By way of a conclusion to the project, I shall ask the question of whether the palm tree is going to be planted, where it is going to be planted, and if it is going to flourish.\r\n\r\nS.D. How and where did you first imagine planting the palm tree?\r\n\r\nS.S. The idea was to conduct a performance on the opening day of the Cyprus Pavilion, but it would take place next to and inside the Giardini, where many of the Biennale Pavilions are located (should we say: the main ones?).\r\n\r\nThe boat would arrive at the waterfront of the Giardini and upload the palm tree which would then be carried on straps by the crew, like a procession of some kind, leading to the Greek Pavilion, where the tree would be planted. This site came immediately to mind since Greece stood for Cyprus in many cases and bears a sense of solidarity. It could also be symbolically connected with the systematic felling of palm trees in Athens during the military dictatorship (as it was characterised a non-Greek plant), so that the city would lose the image of a “developing African capital”. After this, the empty ship would set sail for the official opening of the Cyprus Pavilion.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. Together with the political meaning present in your project, you also raise ecological questions. How do you deal with them, conceptually and practically?\r\n\r\nS.S. Transplanting palm trees, along with the risk of bringing dangerous cobras to a new place or the risk that they will not adapt, deals with the idea of injecting alien species into the environment.\r\n\r\nIt is similar to what people do when they have pets and release them into the wild when they cannot look after them any longer -without anticipating the consequences of their actions. This question of pets also comes to mind when one sees the installation in the Cyprus Pavilion with the cobras’ cage and everything provided for them to be fed.\r\n\r\nWhether the cobras are there or not is to be imagined by the viewer, who is likely to experience the same strange feeling you get in zoos in the presence of the animals which you many never have the opportunity to see if you do not wait long enough.\r\n\r\nBringing the cobras into Venice raised many difficulties and provoked many refusals. But nothing is impossible… These procedures relating to the introduction of palm trees (and the question of whether they will flourish or not) as well as cobras (and whether they will adapt and be accepted or not) strongly echo those that immigrants searching for a new home have to face, giving a new twist to the ecological question.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. How do you deal with the gap between the first ideas you had for the project and the feasibility of its present form?\r\n\r\nS.S. I described an ideal project. I would have loved to see it through to completion in its original form. But some ideas that I originally had were difficult to realise, because they were not authorised by the Venice municipality or by the Biennale organisers for various reasons.\r\n\r\nPlanting a tree in the Giardini in front of the Greek Pavilion, for example, creates a problem with heritage regulations as it is a protected area. Likewise, having snakes stay in the Cyprus Pavilion for six months requires many precautions regarding animal protection.\r\n\r\nI chose to document these difficulties and make them part of the whole project: the refusals together with the entire bureaucratic process (messages and requests, etc.) are presented in the Pavilion, as well as other documentation related to the project: videos, photos and other unexpected things that occurred during the preparation of the exhibition and the performance. \r\n\r\nThis documentation does not have the character of a protest, nor does it bear a condemnatory or critical tone. It is simply a testament of a refusal.\r\n\r\nIn this way (asking for a permit, rejection, documentation), the realisation of the project resembles the everyday political reality of Cyprus characterised by continuous negotiations between the two sides. The procedure is closely connected with the notions of “public” and “private” (if something cannot be done in public, then it is done in a private place).\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. Could you describe the Cypriot political context from the perspective of your own personal history?\r\n\r\nS.S. From a really young age in Cyprus, I had the opportunity to leave the house and wander a lot. I was wandering mostly in the wild. My only fear (fuelled by my childish imagination) was that one day I’d lose my way, cross the “dividing line” 3 and enter the other side. There would be nobody to save me and take me back home.\r\n\r\nThis fear kept growing as I grew older. When I started travelling abroad and would sometimes lose my orientation in a city, I was overcome by the same fear that I’d enter the occupied side. During my 26-month military service at the age of 17, I was stationed in an area called “Kokkina” (meaning “red” in Greek). The area took its name from the blood that was shed there during the intercommunal battles of 1964.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Turkish military base on this site, hundreds of miles away from the Turkish Cypriot –inhabited north. The Greek Cypriots who live there are cut off from the rest of the island and are mostly occupied with the production of wood charcoal (I have also created two of my other projects here: *Illegal Installation* and *My Own Strangers*). The area is of great political importance in the history of the island.\r\n\r\nI was standing guard at one of the checkpoints and my role was to open a gate allowing (or preventing) local people who had farms next to the “Buffer Zone” 4 from passing. One day, I mistakenly opened the gate to a couple of tourists travelling in a car. I had to notify the UN and luckily they made them turn back. At this same spot I saw (again while on guard) a huge unidentified land craft boat all of a sudden coming ashore on the beach in front of me. I was terrified, thinking that the Turks had launched an invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. How did the recent changes in the political situation of your own country affect your work? \r\n\r\nS.S. Even though I live in Athens -which was the first place I visited outside Cyprus, and where I fell in love, matured, developed myself and created a large part of my work- I am often in a position to visit Cyprus, stay there and keep in touch with the island.\r\n\r\nI was present during the huge changes in 2003 (the opening of designated checkpoints along the Green Line) and 2004 (the rejection of the UN Referendum 5 proposed to settle the Cyprus dispute) and had the chance to visit the other side of the island for the first time.\r\n\r\nAll of this changed my work. After I physically crossed the line dividing my island in two and went to explore the rest of it, my work became more physical itself. At this point all the myths, the misconceptions and fears that I had in my mind just collapsed.\r\n\r\nI was feeling very free; all of a sudden, the world had grown bigger and became unified. It was the most enjoyable trip I ever made. What shook me was the natural environment, lying untouched and “abandoned” for 35 years. As a Cypriot saying puts it: ‘A man is his land, and his land, alas, in shambles’.\r\n\r\nAfter this visit to the Turkish Cypriot side, my work dealt more directly with nature. Nikos Xydakis, an art critic, has said about my work that it resembles a verse from the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, raising the artificial and loathing nature. “Give me artificial flowers –porcelain and metal glories neither fading nor decaying, forms unageing.”6\r\n\r\nS.D. “Rumours” are a central theme for your Venice project. How do you articulate this idea with the political question?\r\n\r\nS.S. Rumours are the modern version of myths and legends. Creating myths is a social need. In troubled political situations, rumours run wild since they are fuelled by the unknown, insecurity and fear.\r\nTerrorism has assumed the status of this modern myth through rumours about eminent attacks with a consequence on immigrants who, because of their ethnic origin, often become the first suspects.\r\nIn other contexts, big corporations in the United States nowadays are employing people to create and circulate favourable rumours about their company, thus replacing the advertising industry. These people are not allowed, under contract, to reveal their connection with those corporations. Rumours are a kind of “folkloric” anarchistic expression and in some cases they serve as a way of “letting off steam”. \r\n\r\nS.D. Through the idea of rumours and snakes, you deal with the question of fear: could you elaborate on this?\r\n\r\nS.S. Fear is a feeling that has existed on the island throughout its history because of the political situation and also its geographic position. Rumours and fuss about cobras also created fear, since the Cypriots are not familiar with this kind of reptile. In this instance, it is the fear of the unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the project now, cobras, which are an integral part of it, emphasise the feeling of fear, since many people are afraid to even look at them, or even visit the project, knowing that cobras are a part of it.\r\n\r\nThe archetypal terror (which rests on the basis of fear and religious awe) is spontaneously triggered when we confront these snakes, the sacred beings of the ancient civilisations with whom we share the oldest part of our brain (reptile brain). This gives the project a totally different dynamic.\r\n\r\nS.D. Rumours also pertain to noise. Is this “noise” emanating from the Cyprus Pavilion a tool to give the island’s political questions more visibility on the international scene where the public would not already be aware of the issues?\r\nS.S. Yes. In the same way that a barker was needed to gather people when a travelling theatre was approaching town, I think the rumours emanating from the project could serve as a kind of “barker” to persuade people to take a deeper look at the political situation in Cyprus.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. Do you think that through your work you can make a comment not only on the Cypriot political situation, but also on similar situations elsewhere in the world? If this is the case, do you think that the artist can play a part in changing history?\r\n\r\nS.S. The project deals with a variety of symbolisms but never addresses the political problem directly. Instead it uses a tale, a lot of parables. The viewer can be provoked by it and try to learn something about the actual problems of the island.\r\n\r\nI hope the project is open to a lot of different interpretations and will connect with people in other parts of the world who deal with similar problems. For example, the snake charmers in the project come from India and are the only ones that can charm the sacred snake or lure it out of its supposed hiding place (if we are to believe the rumours). These people not only add an exotic and ironic touch to the project but also strongly relate to the recent political history of India, which in many respects resembles the history of Cyprus (India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Bangladesh etc).\r\n\r\nI am convinced that an artist can not only change the history of art, but also the way people perceive the political situation of their country. An artist can approach or, to an extent, alter political issues in a totally different manner than a politician would do.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.D. In some scientific research on rumours, you find the idea that rumours are as unlikely as the theories trying to explain them. What do you think?\r\n\r\nS.S. At this point we meet poetry.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n<br />\r\n1. In 1974, following a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots and the forces controlled by the Athens junta, Turkey conducted a military offensive capturing approximately 37% of Cypriot territory. The resulting division enforced a strategic split between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to the southern and northern parts of the island respectively.\r\n\r\n2. See pages 50-54.\r\n\r\n3. Also known as the “Green Line”, this refers to the cease fire line that de facto divides the island of Cyprus in two. It was first established in 1964, and became impassable following the political events of 1974.\r\n\r\n4. The “Buffer Zone” in Cyprus is a United Nations-controlled security zone established at the limits of the areas occupied by Turkish armed forces. It runs for more than 300 km along the Green Line, and its width\r\nranges from a few meters in Nicosia to a few kilometers in other areas. \r\n\r\n5. On April 2004, the UN Secretary Kofi Annan proposed a new reunification plan which, following twin referenda, failed to be endorsed –certain key terms of the plan were judged to be unacceptable by an overwhelming percentage of Greek-Cypriot voters.\r\n\r\n6 From the poem Artificial Flowers (1903), in the collection C.

In front of the sand one would be tempted to speak of the sand and its long journeys, from Africa, to the Middle-East, to the Southern coasts of Europe. But the journeys of the sand follow the same routes of the people fleeing wars, interethnic conflicts, and poverty. \r\n\r\nOnce Socratous’ works are broken down into their constituent elements, it is possible to see how each of these elements is in fact a sign that carries a memory. Like words conceal their history within their etymology, Socratous\' sculptures become legible as soon as we interrogate their genesis. How to separate, in theory and in practice, the artwork from the place where it is made, with its affects, its memories, and its turmoil? In other words, any attempt to subject these works to hierarchies between their visual and conceptual execution would harm the complexity of Socratous\' practice: to speak of symbolism or of sheer beauty would be reductive. \r\n\r\nWhat is truly eloquent here is instead the identity of the artwork: their birthplaces are the workshops where Socratous chooses to work, asking for hospitality while altering their normal working routine; their colour is that of the sandstorms that sweep the  Mediterranean regardless of borders, or that of the old buildings that have been erected both in the north and in the south of Cyprus; their shape is determined by will and by skill, but by contingencies as well, like the shape of mountains and of broken things. \r\n \r\nWith a new series of works presented at the end of a Residency at Point, Socratous reflects once again upon the formalisation of issues of identity, contested territories, and displacement. \r\n',NULL),(438,1,'2017-04-05 13:05:28','2017-10-17 10:24:32',NULL,'SENSORIUM SPACE',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'sensorium-space',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nInfo\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n[Sensorium Space](http://www.sensoriumspace.com) is a non-profit team founded on January 2016 in Nicosia.

Described as the “material turn”, new materialism extends the ongoing deconstruction of the human-nature binary and opens up a space in motion that acknowledges the often unpredictable and unwanted actions of human bodies, nonhuman creatures, ecological, organic and machinic systems, chemical agents, and other participants of the life realm. By conceiving matter as an ongoing situation of possession towards modes of self-transformation, self-organisation and directedness, new materialism raises a speculation on ontological hierarchies.\r\n\r\n*Matters as Pleasures, Forces as Things, Bodies as Matters* intents to bring forward the ways in which art allows us to map the complex relations between nature and culture, between body, language and knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo what extent does the “material turn” within the context of cultural production take a different turn from the one of continental epistemology, philosophy and the humanities?

Depending on whether we approach the question from the field of science, philosophy, art, poetry, technology, or politics, what we call ‘matter’ changes. Yet, there is something we can agree upon; matter is like an awkward thing sticking out of your nose. It is a thing, and it is also more than that thing; it is the reality that comes with having a body, but also the possibility of moulding different realities for bodies. And bodies matter. What do you mean when you say that something matters to you? How does matter come to matter? How do artists, poets, philosophers or scientists think through matter? “Matter is a wandering substance. The mind feels a fatal attraction for the impossible; it turns the body into a tool, and a destination” – writes poet and artist Etel Adnan. In this session, through a series of examples drawn from the field of poetry, visual art, feminist thinking and quantum physics, we will discuss different approaches to the question of matter, and the implications of starting from the body/matter.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe session will be structured in three parts: a presentation, a reading session and an informal discussion.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReading List:\r\n<br />\r\n1.

Constitutive material of these chapters is a series of aesthetic materializations of digital three-dimensional models that result from the computational processing of photographic archives, collected by the artist during his visits at urban, institutional and natural landscapes in Cyprus. Fragments of the geological and archaeological substrate, technologies of energy and information management, skins and structures from the inorganic and organic domain interweave in order to trace the historical, epistemological and morphological correlations between natural phenomena, technological infrastructures, the material and intangible manifestations of memory.\r\n\r\nIn *Transformation of Commons* Moris suggests a sequence of displacements on the horizon of matter and time. The movement between systems of knowledge production and sensorial witnessing, between archival documentation and formalistic treatise opens up to a combined field of speculation regarding the past and the future.

Already the tip of the line of shadow almost touches the doorway which marks the centre of the façade. Against the west gable end of the house, the sun falls on the wood about a yard and a half above the flagstone. Through the third window, which looks out on this side, it would reach far into the bedroom if the blinds had not been lowered*.  \r\n\r\nThe prose of Alain Robbe-Grillet’s *Jealousy* (1957) transmits the uncanny feeling of a reverberating space, one that allegedly exists, but is turned into a fragmented illusion by Robbe-Grillet’s constant effort to describe it too meticulously. A good part of Robbe-Grillet’s screenplay for Alain Resnais’ *L’année dernière à Marienbad* (1961) is also dedicated to descriptions of places and things, but here the illusion is even greater, as the images also seem to deny (or at least not fully coincide with) what is being told. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt might be possible, then, that the more precise a description tries to be, the more abstract, partial and misleading it becomes. On the other hand, it is often the case that the more dumb and closed in its concreteness an artwork seems to be, the more conceptually dense and direct it is. Just like ancient statues emerging from the tautological descriptions that abound in archaeology books, such works seem to aspire to merely “being there”, without leaving much room for metaphors and metonymies. But they constantly point at something else, lying elsewhere. They point at a specific place, but we don’t know where that place is.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Draped female figure, standing on a plinth of a roughly ellipsoid shape (length: 58 cm; depth: 36 cm; height: 13 cm).

Yellow flowers glowed in the high grass, surrounded by the high marble columns. It was getting cold. The place was totally silent, nobody was around. We stopped in front of the headless statue of a woman with her right arm folded and resting on her left wrist. It was the same pose as the woman’s in L’année dernière, the only difference being that the latter was sitting and holding a book in her right hand. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Two people sitting in a room.

[...] *In a later 20th-century or early 21st-century film, which is where Gehr’s film is, the event is transposed to another level and we don’t give a damn about these people’s emotions or their characters. We are following completely something else, something that cannot be told in words but can be revealed only through certain rhythms of light...*\r\n\r\nThis is not an exhibition about Cyprus. Personal and subjective, it aims at recreating an atmosphere rather than directly addressing a place, a theme or a topic. The more objective a text tries to be, the more subjective it becomes. Maybe the only way to talk about Cyprus is to talk about *completely something else*, as this text tries to do. In other words, it is possible that by making a point of not addressing the subject directly, one will imperceptibly touch upon it, even if just for a moment.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis text, and the exhibition it accompanies, are personal: they allude to things as I saw them, not necessarily as they are. For example, I noticed that in Nicosia, and throughout the island, the relation of people and things with the space that surrounds them is very specific, as if it were set on a different voltage from the one I experienced elsewhere. And I noticed that every time I asked how things got to be the way they are now, I received different answers, as if, inseparable from space, history was also constantly being negotiated. The thing in itself and its description or account appeared to me as inextricably linked, yet at the same time inevitably contradictory. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*A rabbi, a real cabalist, once said that in order to establish the reign of peace it is not necessary to destroy everything nor to begin a completely new world. It is sufficient to displace this cup or this bush or this stone just a little, and thus everything. But this small displacement is so difficult to achieve and its measure is so difficult to find that, with regard to the world, humans are incapable of it and it is necessary that the Messiah come*. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA small displacement can change everything, turn one world into another, completely different and yet exactly the same. None of us actually knows where to move the cup, the bush or the stone, or where it is they really belong. It is probably the same place ancient statues and some contemporary artworks point at, possibly near, but totally unknown, invisible to us. And despite that, we have all felt, at some point, that things were suddenly in the right position, inexplicably tuned to everything around them. And that something very tangible, material, even dull, like a stone, a feather or a lighter was the key that had once tuned the world and could eventually tune it again, by moving things just a little bit, by placing everything, at least for a moment, exactly where it should be.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe quotations are from: <br />\r\nAlain Robbe-Grillet, *La Jalousie* <br />\r\nVassos Karageorghis, *Sculptures from Salamis I* <br />\r\nJonas Mekas, *Movie Journal; The Rise of New American Cinema, 1959-1971* <br />\r\nGiorgio Agamben, La comunità che viene.',NULL),(460,1,'2017-04-07 09:16:22','2017-10-11 15:50:38',NULL,'TEXT BY MICHELANGELO CORSARO',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'text-by-michelangelo-corsaro',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne would be tempted to forget about wars, interethnic conflicts, refugees, borders, checkpoints and the holes left by bullets on the facade of Ledra Palace Hotel.

But the journeys of the sand follow the same routes of the people fleeing wars, interethnic conflicts and poverty.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first photograph in Socratis Socratous’ book, *The History of the War of Cyprus,* is an image of the southern slope of the Kyrenia mountain. To be precise, it is an image of the portion of the mountainside where an enormous flag of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is painted in white and red - from Nicosia, the flag is visible also at night when it turns monochrome as hundreds of glowing lights reproduce the crescent and the star in-between two horizontal strips. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the next page, a double spread hosts a photograph of a banner in the middle of a crop field reading ΟΧΙ, as part of the campaign to reject the Annan plan for the resolution of the Cyprus dispute. The third photo of the series represents a group of people queuing at a checkpoint on the Turkish-Cypriot side of the buffer zone. What follows is a series of photographs taken between 2003-2004, when Socratous visited for the first time the other side of the island: people, houses, ruins, cafes, abandoned places of a neighbouring *patrida* that for all of his life he had seen only from afar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the next series of pictures, shot a couple of years later in 2006, a photo of a gorgeous landscape of dark green trees in a field of yellow grass seems to work as a picturesque intermission in the midst of a dense political commentary. In fact, the photograph does nothing else than continuing the political commentary, calling into question the very notion of national borders. In the middle of the image, three black triangles hang from gallows: it’s an insect trap, deployed to limit the spread of the red palm weevil, a parasite of palm trees that was possibly introduced to the island when some palms were imported from Egypt to Northern Cyprus in the attempt to give a more eastern and exotic touch to the landscape. The insects quickly spread on both sides of the island. After all, what do national borders mean to animals? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA similar question was to be raised a few years later, when Socratous represented Cyprus at the 2009 Venice Biennale with *Rumours*, an exhibition composed of an installation and a series of performative actions. Here, Socratous invited two Indian snake charmers and their cobras to live in a venetian palazzo; he transported a ten-meter palm tree on a boat up and down the Canal Grande, in the attempt to eventually plant it somewhere on the island; he staged performances warning Venetians of potential snake invasions. The work commented on the rumours circulating on local news that some cobra eggs had been hid in the roots of the palm trees that Northern Cyprus imported from Egypt, and that once the eggs would hatch the cobras would be free to move to the south of the island. Once again, Socratous makes us think about how the checkpoints might be equipped to face a military invasion but not that of poisonous reptiles. But Socratous also resorts to narratives that seem to be deeply embedded in a very subjective gaze, insofar as he translates past traumas into a symbolic language that persists into a form of quasivisual political consciousness. How does Socratous transpose facts into symbols and into images? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2005 the artist installed a charcoal floor in Archimede Staffolini Gallery. The work was a black sculpture, titled *Illegal Installation*, on which people walked freely. It was the result of a research in the traditional coal industry of Pyrgos, a small town on the northern coast of Cyprus. Socratous knew the place because he had spent one year in Kokkina, a few kilometres away, during his military service. Kokkina is a territory of historical importance and a strategically valuable Northern Cyprus beachhead where in 1964, for days, Greek-Cypriot and Turkish- Cypriot factions engaged in violent fights. It was there that Socratous returned to collaborate with the local workers, asking them to work with him on the production of his piece. He provided the material that is generally used to build wooden floors and processed it into a charcoal pile to turn it into a sculptural installation. The whole production process weaves together different research threads: the experimentation with traditional production processes and techniques; the collaboration with workers from the workshops, who are asked to work with the artist and to produce objects in unorthodox ways; the desire to return to places and landscapes that are imbued with personal as much as with historical memories. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce Socratous’ works are broken down into their constituent elements, it is possible to identify what unites them in their artistic methodology. Like words contain their history within their etymology, Socratous’ sculptures become legible as soon as we interrogate their genesis. How are we to separate, in theory and in practice, the artwork from the place where it is made, its affects, its memories, and its turmoil? Any attempt to establish hierarchies between the material and the conceptual would harm the complexity of Socratous’ practice; to speak of symbolism or of sheer beauty would be reductive. What is truly eloquent here is -instead- the identity of the artwork. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2011 the artist produced a large aluminium and bronze piece titled *Module of Urban Landscape*. The metal for the sculpture was obtained from discarded shells and ammunitions used in the Libian Civil War, purchased at an auction in Cyprus and then melted together by the artist. In a second installation of the piece, exhibited in 2015 at Galerie Saint-Severin, Paris, Socratous added bullets and ammunitions, confiscated from a Syrian ship and stocked in Cyprus. Looking at Socratous’ sculptures, it is difficult to ignore the time he spends in industrial workshops, which become a place for reflection, where the thinking is done. Some of the ammunitions exhibited in Paris happened to bear the etched words “Made in France” or “Made in Belgium” and this is no accident but rather the outcome of political, cultural and economic relations that are embedded in the very choice of the materials employed. The workshops are the places where such observations are first made, where the materials are handled, weighted and engaged. Here, Socratous gets to know the metal, its structure and its consistency, but also the workplace, the people, and their histories, moulding all this information together into the identity of his sculptures. The artist developed a collaborative practice of his own so as to produce these works, moving from one workshop to another, asking for hospitality and for help while granted licence to alter their normal working routine. It is in workshops that collaboration becomes itself a research strategy, to learn traditional techniques or to revise them as needed.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same could be said for almost all of Socratous’ most recent production. The works from the series *Stolen Garden* (2009-ongoing) are made using mainly two techniques: traditional metal casting for the bigger pieces and microsculpture for the smaller parts that need jewelry techniques. These works are realised in three Athenian workshops, where for years Socratous returned to work adopting them as some of his many studios. The inspiration for these works comes from the National Gardens of Athens, an island of peace and quiet in the middle of a hectic city. The park was commissioned in 1838 by Queen Amalia of Oldenburg to Friedrich Schmidt, a German agronomist who designed the garden with hundreds of exotic plants that he tried to introduce into the dry Mediterranean climate of Athens, in many cases unsuccessfully. Amalia, who commissioned the garden to be built next to the Royal Palace, was born in Germany and became the first Queen of modern Greece when in 1936 she married King Otto of Greece. One year after surviving an assassination attempt, her regency ended, in 1862, when the King dismissed his Prime Minister provoking a military rebellion. The Queen left Greece on a British warship and returned to her home in Bavaria where she died in exile. In such a historically loaded place Socratous wandered among native and exotic species of plants, looking at forms and shapes to produce his sculptures and reflecting on the character of a city that for two centuries has been contended between the West and the Middle-East, between European Standards and exoticism. The result is a tangle of metal branches and leaves, often installed directly on the floor or on low plinths. Their appearance is diverse, according to the techniques used to produce them: the gold-plated parts are shiny, when the copper is treated in long chemical baths with electricity it takes warty forms, some bronze trunks and leaves bear an opaque patina.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSocratous’ sand casts add another variant to his vocabulary of materials. Exhibited for the first time at Point Centre, Nicosia, in the exhibition Casts of an Island, these objects are obtained by casting fine sand in moulds and cooking it at high temperatures. The result is an unfamiliar material as light as plastic and as fragile as glass, of which Socratous determines hues, textures and forms. The objects are rendered in the colour of the old buildings erected in both the north and the south of Nicosia, which is the colour of Cyprus when in the summer the soil is dry and the fields turn yellow. The shapes of these sculptures are reminiscent of industrial machinery, engines, pipes and tools, of Mycenaean pottery, of medieval bastions, of the Great Mosque of Samarra, and of the tower of Gonbad-e Qabus. Sometimes, where the edges split off, they assume jagged shapes dictated by contingencies, like islands, mountains, and broken things. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong the images consulted by Socratous during the making of these works there is some satellite footage of a sandstorm covering the entire Middle-East, from Egypt, to Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, to the southern border of Turkey. In this photo, Cyprus is almost invisible, cloaked as it is by a thick ochre plume of sand‑to gauge the shape and position of the island one should have in mind an exact representation of its map, for having seen it too many times. To locate the island on the map, to ask “where is Cyprus?” means to raise another question: on which criteria can we base a clear distinction between Europe and the Middle-East?\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n In a paper republished in 2006 in Global Media Journal, Yiannis Papadakis noted how, after the Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004 “the Dead Zone became the easternmost border of the EU, a problematic boundary that has not allowed the EU to precisely delimit itself in the East.” (1) That of precise territorial delimitations seems to be one of the motives that haunts Socratous’ practice. At once a Cypriot, an Athenian, and a European citizen from the Middle-East, his artistic practice cannot but return where the borders are not understood. Hence the obsession for the red palm weevil, for the cobras, for the refugees, and for the parrots that escaped their cages to find a new home in the National Garden of Athens. Contended as they are between East and West, between sand beaches and the hectic premises of a metal foundry, it would be pointless to ask “where do these works belong?” They materialise a mental place in a cast of sand.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1).

Through performance art my body is asking questions that can only be answered when one feels into certain sensory experiences and perhaps interact with them.\r\n\r\nIn the mode of communicating with the viewers senses, environment and state of mind, the body keeps questioning and interact. At the center of the creative thought process, the core issue deals with the interaction and meeting with people. What appears to be known; counteracts with the ‘opposite’ in the face of others. This core is in a constant development and the threads may be synchronized with another. In a silent state of mind, these vibrations are identified through external or internal sequences that can be identified usually through a temporary sensation in the environment.\r\n\r\nWriting about thought compositions while a core sensation of the Performer keeps anoticeablevibration is like creating a moment to engage on another frequency; the body receives and shares as a tuning channel. What interests me is turning into these frequencies, emphasizing their affect on my own body within the action. My own sense experience hovers on the acute level of sensory perceptions. Like penetrating a broken wall to reach the manifestation of the meeting of two people.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCredits: <br />\r\nConcept/Performance: Nicolina Stylianou <br />\r\nTechnical Support: Stelios Andreou <br />\r\nDesign/Constructional assiduity: Marios Messios <br />\r\n\r\n',NULL),(465,0,'2017-04-07 11:37:38','2017-10-12 14:26:30',NULL,'NICOLINA STYLIANOU',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'nicolina-stylianou',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Nicolina Stylianou]( www.nicolinastylianou.com) studied Art & Design at Kingston University, UK. \r\nSelected performances include *]performance s p a c e[*, London; [*GRADIENT: From Gray to Colour Scale*]( https://www.facebook.com/events/253860184810177/), Ioannina, Greece, both in 2015; *Transmission of the triangle*; *Growth*, both in 2014; *Abbey of Silence*, 2013.

The title is a reformulation of the slogan used by the Lumière brothers, inventors of the cinematograph, and is thus a direct reference to the way they conceived the medium. Panayiotou radically rejects all representation and narrative, the main engines of today’s movies. The dark void of *To Bring Back the World to the World* is itself derived from one of the mainstays of the mainstream cinema, namely the “black frames” that punctuate Walt Disney’s *Mary Poppins* (1964). The film is assembled by adding up all of the black frames, which refer to all the interstices of an image sequence, generally projected at 24 frames per second. It is the rapid succession of these frames that produces the illusion of an animated sequence. By using the interstices as such, the sequence is reduced to a black monochrome. Like off-screen action in the moves, the absence of pictures gives free rein to an unrestricted imagination.\r\n',NULL),(467,1,'2017-05-30 23:55:09','2017-05-30 23:55:09',NULL,'THE LISTENING GROUP',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-listening-group',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(468,1,'2017-06-04 21:31:38','2017-06-04 21:56:28',NULL,'POINTâ€“ELENEIO: MAGIC CARPET',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'point-eleneio-exhibition-magic-carpet',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(469,1,'2017-10-11 11:58:39','2017-10-13 11:40:17',1,'POLINA NIKOLAOU',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'polina-nikolaou',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Polina Nikolaou](http://polinanikolaou.com/) (b. 1986, Cyprus) holds a BA in History from University of Athens, an MA in Landscape and Culture from University of Nottingham, UK, and a PhD in Historical/Cultural Geography and Museology from University of Exeter, UK, entitled *The diaspora of Cypriot antiquities and the British Museum, 1860-1900*. \r\nShe is a museum and cultural heritage consultant with scholarly outputs (articles and conference presentations) on the history of (Cypriot) archaeology. \r\n\r\nHer work has two interrelated strands: academic research and public history.

He called this discipline Kulturwissenschaft (science of culture), himself a Bildhistoriker (image historian), and his method iconology: literally a combination of the study of word and image that relied on merging a historical with a meta-historical approach to various forms of visual expression. Warburg’s pioneering meta-historical turn of the study of art owed much to contemporaneous psychology, anthropology, and the analysis of religious beliefs. At the same time, he promoted a historical turn that relied on close attention to the political and social ramifications of culture. Warburg thus combined the evolutionist theory of his days with a positivistic study of historical documents. After focusing first on the Italian Renaissance, he turned his attention to the German Reformation and to the subsequent scientific revolution. Crucial times of crisis, he believed, had activated an evolution of thinking toward the Enlightenment, although any human being maintained the potential for regression to irrational behavior. Enlightenment as a remaking of Classical Antiquity—both intellectual and material—was, according to Warburg, achievable only through a necessary balance between individual experience and the perception of generally comprehensible abstracted “symbolic” forms. Such forms, he believed, were coined in archaic times and peaked in Classical Antiquity. Subsequently all his studies were dedicated at a phenomenon that he called the Nachleben der Antike (Afterlife of Antiquity).\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOxford Bibliographys',NULL),(481,1,'2017-10-12 18:02:41','2017-10-12 18:06:26',NULL,'INDIAN SNAKE CHARMER',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'indian-snake-chramer',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(482,1,'2017-10-16 14:29:02','2017-10-16 14:29:02',NULL,'APARTAMENTO',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'apartamento',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(483,1,'2017-10-17 10:37:58','2017-10-17 10:37:58',NULL,'PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE ARTS SEMINARS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'phenomenology-and-the-arts-seminars',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nDates of seminars\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nFirst Seminar: 13 February 2016 <br />\r\n[Second Seminar](https://vimeo.com/234443347): 27 February 2016 <br />\r\nThird Seminar: 12 March 2016 <br />\r\nFourth Seminar: 19 March 2016 <br />\r\nFifth Seminar: 26 March 2016 <br />\r\nGuest speaker: Zöe Dominique Sutherland: 16 April 2016 <br />\r\nGuest speaker: Suzan Kozel: 27 May 2016 <br />\r\n\r\n',NULL),(484,1,'2017-10-17 10:46:28','2017-10-17 10:46:28',NULL,'ANDREAS VRAHIMIS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'andreas-vrahimis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<br />\r\nBio\r\n\r\n[Andreas Vrahimis](https://www.academia.edu/search/advanced/?q=Andreas%20Vrahimis) (b. 1983, Cyprus) holds a PhD in Philosophy from Birkbeck, University of London, an MA from Goldsmiths College, University of London, and a BA (Hons) from the University of Nottingham. \r\n\r\nHe has taught at the University of Cyprus, the Cyprus University of Technology and European University Cyprus, and has held an Honorary Research Fellowship at Birkbeck, University of London.
